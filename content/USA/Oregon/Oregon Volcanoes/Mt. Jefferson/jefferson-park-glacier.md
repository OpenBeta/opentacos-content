# Description
From Jefferson Park ascend scree slopes above timberline to the start of the Jefferson Park Glacier. Head more or less up the middle of the glacier as crevasses will dictate the path. About two thirds of the way up the glacier the angle increases. Some parties may belay some short snow/ ice pitches. Weave around some larger crevasses as you head towards the bergschrund. It can be passed on either right or left side. Take warning: passing the bergschrund on the left side greatly increases the exposure to rock fall. Once above the bergschrund ascend a moderately  steep exposed snow slope until gaining the cinder ridge. Follow the rock ridge east towards the summit pinnacle. Two exposed pitches of OK rock (5.0) will get you to the final broad ridge and the summit pinnacle. The pinnacle is a few pitches of 4th class on shattered rock. The view on top is outstanding!

Most wise parties will descend the Whitewater Glacier back to Jefferson Park. Expect the climb to take between 4-6 hrs from timberline and the descent to take just as long via the Whitewater Glacier. Don't underestimate the length of the descent (long slog). Avoid descending the North Ridge.

# Location
Starts from Jefferson Park on the north flank of the mountain. This is one of the most beautiful spots in the state. The meadows of Jefferson Park are extremely popular. Stay on the main trails. Keep impact to an absolute minimum in the park. Camp in established sites!

Jefferson Park is reached in 5 miles via the Whitewater Trail, which begins on the west side of the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness. Fill out self issued permits at the trailhead.

To find the trailhead from Highway 22 (6 miles east of the town of Idanah), drive 6 miles on F.S. Road 2243 until its end. The parking area is almost always full in summer, especially on weekends. Have fun!

# Protection
Ice axe, crampons, glacier gear. Maybe a few pickets in early season, ice screws after August 1st. A select few pieces of rock pro for the ridge traverse. HELMET!!!
