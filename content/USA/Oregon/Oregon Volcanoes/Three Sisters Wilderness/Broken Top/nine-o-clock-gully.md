# Description
This is the short gully at nine o'clock when facing north toward the summit of Broken Top in the Crook Cirque. It is slightly steeper on average than the Eleven O'clock (55 degrees) and needs a lot of snow to be "in." It may also have a cornice.

From the top either down climb the route, or hike over and descend the Eleven O'clock depending on which looks easiest. You can also traverse the West Face to the Northwest Ridge and climb to the summit.

# Location
at 9 o'clock when facing north to the summit from inside the crater

# Protection
pickets?
