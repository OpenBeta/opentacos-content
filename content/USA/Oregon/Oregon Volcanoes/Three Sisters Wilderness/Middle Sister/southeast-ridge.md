# Description
This is probably the simplest route on Middle Sister, though the slightly steeper north ridge is more fun. This is a very straightforward climb from the Chambers Lakes area.

My understanding is that this is a very popular ski descent and certainly it crossed my mind how good it would be for that while hiking on it.
