# Description
This route is one of three routes on the north face of South Sister. The face steepness is on average 45 degree with steeper steps along the way. The face is around 1000 feet high. The Silver Couloir is the left most route and works it way through the rocks bands via snow ramps. Best done early season when there is lots of snow with perhaps a wee bit of ice.

# Location
The north side of South Sister is often over looked because of the approach length and the relatively short route length. However, the routes are of good quality and make for a fine two day adventure. That said, one can approach from the south via Green Lakes and the Prouty Glacier or from the north via Pole Creek. Best done early season so one can ski in. One can bivy at the base of the north face on the Skinner Glacier.

One can descend the North Ridge back to their bivy or carry up and over descending (skiing) the South Side.

# Protection
Two tools and if climbing roped, pickets and screws
