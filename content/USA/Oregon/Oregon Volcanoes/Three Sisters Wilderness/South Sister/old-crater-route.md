# Description
This route climbs the southeast ridge of South Sister between Lewis and Prouty glaciers, beginning near Green Lakes. For the great majority of its length, it is either an easy scree slog or snow climb. Near the top there are some scrambling sections, most notably a cliffband which is either a sketchy 4th class downclimb or a very short rappel. From there, more loose scrambling past Hodge Crest (pointy east summit) leads to the crater and the true summit.

# Location
Hike to Green Lakes from the Green Lakes Trailhead. Find a way to cross Fall Creek (outlet of Green Lakes) and gain the route.

# Protection
Maybe a sling if you decide to rap the small cliffband
