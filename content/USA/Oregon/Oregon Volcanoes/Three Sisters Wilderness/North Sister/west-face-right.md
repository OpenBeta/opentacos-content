# Description
Straightforward route up 35-45 degree snow slopes with possible seasonal alpine ice. One can cut in from the col between North and Prouty Point, traversing moderate snow to join this route, making for a very direct climb and cutting out lots of circuitous gendarme navigation and the first half of the "terrible traverse."

# Location
West face of North sister. Right of the large rock buttress. Another route, the West Face direct climbs left of this buttress.

# Protection
solo, or pickets for the traverse
