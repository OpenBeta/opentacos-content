# Description
The crux is the summit pinnacle. Pretty good rock for an Oregon peak.

# Location
Start where the Thielsen trail crosses the PCT, on the west ridge. Mostly 2nd class until you reach the summit pinnacle. then a short bit of 3rd and 4th class to reach the summit.

# Protection
Most people solo this. The 4th class is 30 feet. There is webbing at the top for rapping but downclimbing is not difficult
