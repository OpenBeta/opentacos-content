# Description
Decent route for the amount of loose conglomerate. Several problems can be found, but only a few could manage the amount of force exerted by a person's weight (especially when you include smaller crimps). Larger moves and hand-holds are king, these larger features should hold up well.

Best you go at low-tide to avoid a wet landing.

# Location
Start above the barnacle line, as these will slough off with minimal traction. Start on the large, low volume under and left of the overhang facing east. Standing start.

# Protection
Pad, healthy ankles if falling on sand.
