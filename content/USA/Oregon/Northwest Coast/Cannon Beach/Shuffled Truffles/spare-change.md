# Description
Straightforward beta beyond the undercling crouch start. Progresses to tension-y presses, wide pulls, and comfy feet. Finishes up-right of the undercling start.

The finish requires a pull on a big, sharp feature that has a visible crack. Kick-tested and seemingly solid, the hold shouldn't blow.

# Location
Start is far right on the face with the low sand-tunnel; undercling between/left of the main light-angle overhang and the waist-high boulder wedged under the chief rock.

# Protection
n/a; 2-3 pads ideally, good ankles for the confident bunch.
