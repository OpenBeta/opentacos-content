# Description
Wide placements in the middle of the route are obvious, then the best climbing is above: sustained 1-2 inch jamming and stemming leads to a few exciting but well protected face moves to reach the anchor.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Gear to 5 inch, though if you're creative and 10b is nowhere near your limit you could do without the #5 (but I wouldn't).
