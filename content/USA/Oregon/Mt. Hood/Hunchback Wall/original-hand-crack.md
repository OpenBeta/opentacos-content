# Description
Mantle onto the obvious 10 foot block leaning against the cliff right where the trail hits the cliff. In 2010 this was the only route with an apparent anchor, and you can see why is was perhaps the first route done here. Standard and stout hand crack, go get some.

# Location
Where the trail hits the wall, this hand crack starts above the obvious 10 foot block leaning against the cliff

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches
