# Description
While this route can be done in two, or even three pitches, it is best done in one clean run to the top. Climb up GiantÂ’s Direct, and rather than going to the belay anchor, follow the bolts up into a dish. Pull through the top of the dish on a couple thin holds, and then continue up to a small roof. Climb through the small roof on big holds and finish to the top. Rap off descent anchors.

# Location
Straight up from Giant's Direct.

# Protection
14 bolts
