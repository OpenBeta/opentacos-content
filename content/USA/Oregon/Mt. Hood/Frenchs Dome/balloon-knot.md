# Description
New route bolted 8/29/18 as a birthday present for Becca. Clip a low first bolt and pull through the crux then head up for some mellower moves to the anchor. For the second pitch traverse left and up some airy 5.8 to the anchors of Low Voltage. This can be lead as one long pitch too.   You could also lead the first pitch and use it as an alternative start to Static Cling 5.10.

# Location
To the left of Giants Direct and finishes at the anchors for Low Voltage. From the parking lot take the mellow trail that heads down and right and it will lead right to the start. Or take the left trail down by the big platforms and walk all the way down to the lowest routes (tin tangle, giants staircase, giants direct) and then start walking back up the hill on the other side and it starts right at 2 new wooden steps.

# Protection
5 bolts on then first pitch (and 2 for the anchor). Second pitch has 3 bolts (and 2 for your anchor).
