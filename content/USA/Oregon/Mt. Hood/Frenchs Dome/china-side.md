# Description
Climb past the first two bolts of

China Syndrome

then traverse left to finish on

Dark Side

, avoiding the cruxes of both routes. Somewhat strenuous climbing at the bottom of

China Syndrome

quickly turns to 5.10 after the traverse. Long draws on bolts 3 and 4 will help to reduce rope drag. This is a fun, less pumpy alternative to

China Syndrome

and maybe a good intro to the steeper climbing at French's for the 5.11 climber.

Given the number of variation routes at French's, I'd be surprised if someone hasn't already done this. If you have any credible FA info please let me know.

# Location
Start as for

China Syndrome
