# Description
This route sends solid rock, but the bolt spacings are a little intimidating. At the first bolt, climb up and right, then climb up the right side of the blocky spine.

# Location
Start on the downhill side. There is a large right-tending slabby staircase, right of Giant's Staircase.

# Protection
5 bolts. Steel biners on the anchors. As always, if doing multiple laps on a route, please use your own draws, then lower off the fixed biners when done.
