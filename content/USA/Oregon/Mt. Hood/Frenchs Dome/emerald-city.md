# Description
Crux at the second bolt. The rest is relatively easy.

Once up there, take the time to look behind you to enjoy a view of Mount Hood.

# Location
Immediately to the left of Straw Man

# Protection
9 bolts

If you have a stick it might be wise to clip the first bolt beforehand as you start moving left leaving you belayer unable to assist you if you fall. It's not hard to get to the first bolt but you never know.

NO STEEL BINERS at the top. There are two long chains.
