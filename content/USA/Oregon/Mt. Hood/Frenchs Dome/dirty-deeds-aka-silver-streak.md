# Description
One of the better routes here.  It's relatively steep with lots of small incut holds.  There's a great section of sustained 5.10 climbing between the 2nd and 5th bolts.

Due to its moderate grade it sees a fair amount of traffic on busy days.

# Location
Silver Streak is belayed from the second from bottom belay platform.  Walk down from the parking lot and take the main trail downhill to the route.

# Protection
8 bolts. Steel biners on the anchors. As always, if doing multiple laps on a route, please use your own draws, then lower off the fixed biners when done.
