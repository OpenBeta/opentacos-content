# Description
Climb the first two bolts on what is now Road Kill, and then traverse up and left into 4 finishing bolts to an anchor.

Starts with a difficult boulder problem to a decent edge where you can get an ok shake. Then launch into about 25' of sustained 11+ edges to a good hold and easier moves in the top 1/3 of the route.

Stick clipping the 2nd bolt is recommended due to location of bolt due to rock quality.

# Location
Starts as for Road Kill, and then goes into the second route to the left of Road Face (first prominent bolted route when you reach the crag.)

# Protection
5 bolts
