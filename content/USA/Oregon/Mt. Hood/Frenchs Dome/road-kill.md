# Description
Take the first two bolts of Road Rage, and then continue straight up for 3 more bolts to the anchor. Hard boulder problem to a good edge, then a few more difficult moves going up and right, to an easier finish. Pretty sustained for the grade.

Stick clipping the 2nd bolt is recommended due to location of bolt due to rock quality.

# Location
first route to the left of Road Face (first prominent bolted route when you reach the crag.)

# Protection
5 bolts
