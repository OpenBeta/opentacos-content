# Description
BSD is the direct start for Road Rage. Rather than starting as for Road Kill, start at the edge of the first built tier, and go straight up into Road Rage to the Road Rage anchors. Thin and sustained crimping until the 4th bolt clipping hold, then about 20' of sustained 11+ edges with only one decent hold to get a quick shake on until about 2/3 up. Then it gets easier to the anchors. Fun and powerful movement through the crux.

I'd recommend stick clipping the

2nd glue in bolt

, as it is very hard to clip during the crux.

# Location
second route to the left of Road Face (first prominent bolted route when you reach the crag.)

# Protection
6 bolts - Merges with Road Rage at the 3rd bolt.
