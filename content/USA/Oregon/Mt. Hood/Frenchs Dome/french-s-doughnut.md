# Description
A very interesting and pumpy route that links up a lot of French's harder routes.  The crux move comes in the middle, with an off-balance lock off and high step, but the beginning is powerful and the end of High Voltage is the redpoint crux, containing big moves to decent holds.  The rock is a bit crumbly in spots, but for the most part good when it needs to be, and it will only get better.  There are good shakes too, so use them wisely, because the pump will catch up if you don't.

# Location
Begin up the Dark Side (the Siege) and start traversing right after 2nd clip into China Man and then keep traversing, crossing Jackie Chan, BSD, Road Kill, Road Face, moving always upwards until you end on High Voltage, clipping the last three of its bolts.  (The shiny bolts are the ones added in order to connect everything together, so look for them.)

# Protection
Bolts.
