# Description
The Siege could be considered the test piece of French'es Dome. The business comes early on this route, the first 20 feet contain the crux. Tenuous sidepulls coupled with a few long lockoffs characterize the crux, into an interested match. As you move over the bulge the climbing eases off greatly, so long as your pump doesn't ruin your redpoint.

# Location
To the right of Pump-o-Roma

8 or 9 bolts, two bolt anchor
