# Description
Bouldery moves down low lead to a jug. A few long reaches and then a series of crimps takes you toward the the beehive-shaped feature up and right. Jugs to the chains.

# Location
Just right of

China Syndrome

. Look for the bulbous feature 3/4 of the way up the wall.

# Protection
Bolts to a chain anchor.  The recent addition of ground-stabilizing platforms has made the first bolt superfluous, as it's easy to clip off the ground. Start from the lower platform if you want to add a few hard moves (ups the grade to 12a/b). 11d grade is for start off the next tier
