# Description
This line is just left of the start for Yellow Brick Road, and crosses over it briefly. Somewhat pumpy 11+ climbing gets you to the second to last draw. Make a strenuous clip then enter the bouldery crux, 4 big moves on small crimps. Clip the last draw and don't fall off the good crimps on your way to the anchors.
