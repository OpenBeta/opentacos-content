# Description
Big moves on small edges for the first half of the route. A great rest about 1/3 way up on a large horn, followed by another at 2/3. The crux comes at the top where opposition movement comes into play. A key jug came off recently making the final moves slightly harder.

# Location
Second route in from the right. The route is directly in front of where the trail hits the Dome, and is the first obvious bolted line.

# Protection
6 bolts
