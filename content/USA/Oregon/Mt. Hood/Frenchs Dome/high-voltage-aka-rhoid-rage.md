# Description
One of the most overhung routes at French's (and definitely one of the dirtier ones). BUT: I cleaned it a bunch summer '08 and must say it is really fun! I couldn't figure out how to clip the last bolt, as the route naturally climbs a bit right of it, so I skipped it- clean falls if you miss the victory jug near the anchor.  Enduro, overhanging edges lead to a bouldery finish.  Do it!

# Location
As you approach the wall from the trail, this is the first route you arrive at.

# Protection
Bolts.
