# Description
The only moderate route on this portion of the wall. This route features long reaches between good holds. The climbing eases after the 5th bolt, however the pump crux might throw you. A clipping hold broke near the 5th bolt recently, which has made the clip a bit harder.

# Location
To the right of The Siege

# Protection
8 bolts, two bolt anchor
