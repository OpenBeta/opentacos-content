# Description
A nice low-angle climb protected by good bolts with lots of incut holds.  It gets a lot of sun in the morning but cools off nicely in the afternoon.

# Location
Immediately to the left of Silver Streak.  Belay from the lowest terrace.

# Protection
8 bolts. Steel biners on the anchors. As always, if doing multiple laps on a route, please use your own draws, then lower off the fixed biners when done.
