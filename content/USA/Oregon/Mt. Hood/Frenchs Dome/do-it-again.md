# Description
A great beginners lead, as there are plenty of bolts and fun climbing. Start at the base of Giant's Staircase, and head directly up. The line ascends up the left side of a prominent blocky rib, just left of Tin Tangle (a slightly run-out 5.7 sport climb). Going up Do It Again and then heading straight up the finish to Giant's Staircase is the most direct way up to the top of the Dome. Someone has placed a bolt above the anchor to protect the moves into the finish. 5 extra bolts if going all the way to the top.

# Location
Directly above the start to Giant's Staircase.

# Protection
8 bolts and chain anchors. Steel biners on the anchors. As always, if doing multiple laps on a route, please use your own draws, then lower off the fixed biners when done.
