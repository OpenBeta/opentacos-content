# Description
Link-up of the crux start of the

Dark Side

into the pumpy section of

China Syndrome

. Extends the

DS

crux section a few more moves; through the traverse with the new bolt. The jugs on

China Syndrome

feel a bit worse after pulling the powerful crux of the

Dark Side

- making the link up a bit harder.
