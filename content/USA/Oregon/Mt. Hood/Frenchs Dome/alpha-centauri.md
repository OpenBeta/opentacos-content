# Description
Alpha Centauri thins out a bit in the middle section.  Some resources list this as a 5.7, but it's generally considered a 5.8.  Generally considered a good beginner's lead however it can be a bit tricky in that you can't always see the next bolt ahead of you (but they pretty much go straight up, every 8 feet or so).

# Location
Just to the right (uphill) of Oz and to the left (downhill) of Straw Man.  I believe the belay platform is the last (lowest) of the newly reinforced platforms.

# Protection
8 bolts; steel biners on the anchors. As always, if doing multiple laps on a route, please use your own draws, then lower off the fixed biners when done.
