# Description
Crankenstein, like Silver Streak, is also among the better routes at French's.  It's a bit steeper and a lot pumpier but the rock is quite good and skin-friendly, so do a few laps!

It's really easy to set up a TR on this route by climbing Silver Streak to the left and then traversing 10ft. over to the anchors of Crankenstein.

# Location
Just right of Silver Streak, towards the bottom of the dome.
