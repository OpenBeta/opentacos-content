# Description
This is an alternate start to Giant's Staircase. Climb easy moves with giant holds to either the first belay anchor of Giant's Staircase, and continue up Giant's Staircase to the top, or go up and left onto the ledge with an anchor and rap rings.

This is also the start for Static Cling, 5.10b.

# Location
If you are standing at the base of the steps up Giant's Staircase, walk 20' to the left and around the corner, and you will see a cleaned section with bolts going up it.

# Protection
5 bolts plus anchor if only going to the first anchor. Bring 6-8 more if going to the top of the dome via Giant's Staircase.
