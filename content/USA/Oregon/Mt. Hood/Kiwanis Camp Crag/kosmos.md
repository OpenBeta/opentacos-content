# Description
Large holds to start, a few powerful moves then can veer left to the mossy crack (1"-2" gear) or right to merge with Dreamin. Holds thin near the top.

# Location
Near center of the crag, bolted line along the blocky flake to the left of the obvious tree.

# Protection
Bolt with 1"-2" gear placements if finish via the crack
