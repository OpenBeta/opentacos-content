# Description
Starts with some juggy holds, gets dirty and slopey as you move up.

Olson calls this a good trad lead route, but I've only TRed it.

# Location
Obvious seam in the rock with an adjoining slanting seam at the bottom. From the top out trail, you'll see the anchors on the wall behind the trail, you'll need to use a rope protector or set a rebelay where your rope runs over the edge, there's a good crack for cams at the edge that you can set before you go over the edge.

# Protection
A couple bolts down low, Gear to 2" near the top
