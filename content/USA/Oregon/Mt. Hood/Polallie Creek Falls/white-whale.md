# Description
White Whale is the center of the main flow at Pollalie Canyon. There are many variations you can take but all will be around the WI4 range. Walk off from the top to the east and rappel/downclimb off of trees.

# Location
I like the ski approach down the landslide, however watch out for avalanche danger, holes in snowpack at the creek bed, rockfall, and the ice cone that forms at the bottom of the main waterfall. It is a great ski run if the conditions are right.

There is also a snowshoe/hiking approach making a long descending traverse about 1/4 mile down canyon from the landslide (landslide ends directly at the base of the climbs)

# Protection
ice screws, all sizes
