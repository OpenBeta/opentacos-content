# Description
P1: Belay under a rock roof under the second large ice flow left of the running waterfall. Rock roof protects from ice but has poor quality rock barely hanging on. Climb to the right around the rock following lower angle ice up and left directly below massive death daggers (move quickly). Set a belay in a cave tucked as safely away from death daggers as possible. Ice difficulty is ~WI3, but when we climbed it was in very sketchy condition with poor quality thin ice over muddy and loose rock. Not recommended for a WI3 leader. Length: ~45m

P2: Move out of cave up and left to gain large vertical pillar. Head straight up and enjoy vertical ice of better quality. As steepness fades so does ice quality. Continue up until you pass through bushes and into steep snow. When I did this snow was heavy and unconsolidated and required extensive burrowing. While digging I found a couple small pine trees buried that can be slung for pro. Move up and left to a larger tree to belay. WI5. Length: ~25m.

# Location
