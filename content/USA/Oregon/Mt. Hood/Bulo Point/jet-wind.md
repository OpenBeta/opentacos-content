# Description
"This area classic is the second-best route in the crag next to

Jet Stream

. At the first bolt, climb up and right. Follow a series of closely spaced bolts on secure holds with airy exposure. The route's middle section is steep and sustained. Continue to the rock's top and top-chains. This well-protected route makes an excellent lead climb and is highly recommended." -
