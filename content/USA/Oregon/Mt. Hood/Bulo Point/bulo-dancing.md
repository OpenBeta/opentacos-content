# Description
The off width crack in the second gully, some stemming and off width moves, but many jugs both in and out of the crack. Crux is just off the ground.

# Location
The obvious large off-width crack 3/4 up the second gully between Jet Wind and Flying Meatball. Best approached from above by scrambling above the campsite on top of Bulo and rapping in.

# Protection
A few 4"+ pieces or can be easily done as a top rope.
