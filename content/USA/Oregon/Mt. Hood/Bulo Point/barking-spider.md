# Description
Easy sport route.

# Location
Located inside the wedge block ravine. On the east facing wall (left as you look up the ravine). Getting there is probably the most interesting part of the route. We accessed from the top of Plumber's Crack then traversing to the right and scrambling up to the first bolt, effectively climbing as a second pitch to that route. Placed one cam to protect the scramble to the first bolt but not necessary. You could also access by a slightly sketchy scramble up from under the wedge block. Might be able to access via a traversing rappel from the upper area, no beta on that. Rappel twice to main lower lobby.

# Protection
5 or 6 bolts. Bolted anchors.
