# Description
This climb is a mix of stemming and classic hand jams. The crux is about half way up and can be surmounted with a couple of good hand jams.

# Location
Located in the gully between Jet Stream and Black Market Organ Doner. Scramble up the rock between these two climbs and head to the back of the gully. Ascend the crack on the right hand side. Rappel down using the Black Market Organ Doner anchors. If you climb up Black Market Organ Doner you can set up a top rope for this climb. Be sure to extend the anchor with long slings.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches. Solid protection and shares the bolt anchors with Black Market Organ Doner.
