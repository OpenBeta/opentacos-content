# Description
This route is one of the hardest at Bulo Point. Begin the climb by following an easy ramp and clipping the first bolt of 'Separated At Birth'. Angle left towards another relatively easy clip. Here is where the difficulty begins. There are a number of different options for making it through the next 10-15 feet. There are some crimps out left and some decent sidepulls in the discontinuous flake system. The difficulties ease after the fourth bolt, with a few easy but somewhat awkward moves leading to the chains.

Not the best rock in the area, but the route climbs well and is a good challenge for those looking for something a bit more difficult.

# Location
Located in the first gully (on the left) you come to when approaching from the parking. This route shares a start and finish with 'Separated At Birth'. It is located across from 'Silence Of The Cams'.

# Protection
Approx 4 or 5 bolts
