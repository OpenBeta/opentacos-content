# Description
"This splendid route sends perfect rock. It used to follow the crack system to the left of the top bulge, but was recently bolted and now tackles the top bulge. Make an exciting long lock-off balancing on small footholds to a large handhold. Climb through to the top-chains." -

Falcon Guide's 'Rock Climbing Oregon' 2006

# Location
