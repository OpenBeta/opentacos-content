# Description
Really fun route. Start in the tiny alcove at the bottom and make some fun little chimney moves to get yourself into position to get over the ceiling / buldge.  Use good holds and heel hook to power through the crux.  The rest is a really enjoyable 5.7 face to top chains that the 10b shares next to it.

# Location
As you are heading down the trail along the bottom of the crag, this is one of the last routes you come to.  It's the last big rock pillar that's right on the trail and it kind of has this double alcove thing at the bottom with a ceiling on the left side (which is the crux of the 10b to the left).

# Protection
Several bolts up top with a top chain.  The first bolt is just above the crux but cannot be reached until you pull through, so if you blow that you have a pretty rough landing.  Do  yourself a favor and use a stick clip or supplament below the bolt with some medium size gear.
