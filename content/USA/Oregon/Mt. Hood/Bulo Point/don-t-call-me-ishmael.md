# Description
An overhanging route among mostly slab climbs.  It has very positive holds although you may find the integrity of one or two questionable.  Climb up onto a ledge, the rest of the route is then just a bolted boulder problem.

# Location
This route is on the obvious overhang to the right of all the slab routes in the lower area.  It's good in case of rain.

# Protection
3 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor
