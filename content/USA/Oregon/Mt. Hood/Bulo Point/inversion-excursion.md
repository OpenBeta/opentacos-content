# Description
"This route lies at the gully's top on the north-side wall. Climb the crack and faces to a ledge below the first bolt; this section can be supplemented with traditional protection. Step right to a flake, then climb the ramp-face past several bolts to the top anchors. The top anchors do not have chains, so a walk off is necessary. The balancy crux comes between the first and second bolts." -

# Location
