# Description
This route is described as the best route at Bulo Point and I am not one to argue. This route ascends the left side of the central spine at the main area. If there is one word to describe this long, airy, route it is "relentless." The first clip is a good distance off the ground but it's a pretty simple scramble to get to it. From there, step out onto the detached flake (awkward) and start heading up. There is rarely a good place to take a break and the exposure is heady. The route takes you over three or four bulges that each act like their own crux, with an odd, but not the hardest one, coming at the top.

# Location
Head to the bottom of the crag, the trail forks right and down hill up top.  Follow this around and pass a couple spires and come to the "Main Area" with the fortified belay areas. Jet Stream and Wind are on the tall central pillar with the orange lichen.

# Protection
9 Bolts plus top anchors. A guy who was out there said you could hang a rope from the top by rock hopping up top but that looked totally crazy.  We warmed up on the enjoyable 5.8 "Jet Wind" which shares the first bolt and heads right and then switched the rope over to Jet Stream's anchor.
