# Description
Climb up into the hand crack and jam this leftward to a stance. These moves are not trivial. Crimp your way on friable flakes up to the crux sidestep. Serious pendulum fall potential here. Latch the jugs and clip the second bolt. Enjoy the thin but positive slab up to a ledge, and some more pulls to the anchor. This route shares an anchor with DaKine to the right, if you'd rather top-rope this.

# Location
Northeast Section, around the corner from

Don't Call Me Ishmael.

# Protection
5 bolts, gear to 3" to protect the start
