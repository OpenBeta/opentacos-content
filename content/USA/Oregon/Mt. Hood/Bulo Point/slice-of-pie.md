# Description
One of the few but truly exceptional crack climbs at Bulo. Short, sweet, and takes good pro all the way to the anchor. No rappelling material is on the anchor as of fall 2019 so you will have to rap off an anchor on the other side of the tower.

# Location
Scramble up the narrow ravine with the wedged block in it to a belay ledge or climb any of the routes in the Lower Lobby to the left of Nook and Cranny

# Protection
Cams and nuts to 2 inches
