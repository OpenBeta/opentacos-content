# Description
"Climb the ceiling's right side, and squeeze through a shallow chimney to a pleasant face. The 5.8 start has good holds to pull through the overhang. The difficult crux comes at the route's top. Climb over the overhanging bulge on sloping handholds to the top-chains." -

Falcon Guide's 'Rock Climbing Oregon' 2006
