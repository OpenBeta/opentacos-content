# Description
Some thin airy moves at the beginning lead to jug hauling higher up. A single bolt at the belayer's feet keeps them from being pulled down the gully.

# Location
Up the second gully between Jet Wind and Flying Meatball. Within that gully, this is the bottom-most climb, or climber's left-most. Best approached from above by scrambling above the campsite on top of Bulo and rapping in.

# Protection
8 or 9 bolts. Rap hanger anchor.
