# Description
A strange little route that's by no means as bad as its neighbor, Hoss, but also by no means fantastic.  Follow the first few bolts through 5.9 climbing.  Once below the large flake, make a few technical moves through the crux.  Then scramble to the anchors on non-descript jugs and Area 51 crystals.

This route is very infrequently climbed and has some loose rock and hold breakage potential.  If it were climbed more regularly, it might clean up to a two-star route, but probably not much more.

# Location
Second closest bolt line to the parking lot.  Follow the approach trail past Hoss.  About 100 feet or so past, the main trail switches back left.  There's a smaller trail that goes another 25 feet past a very large Ponderosa Pine.  This route is the lone bolted line on the face here, look for the right-facing flake feature about 2/3 of the way up.

# Protection
Quickdraws, two-bolt anchor, no chain or rap rings.
