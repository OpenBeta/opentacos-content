# Description
Clamber up the starting boulder, reach up, around an overhang for the first clip, then move into the crux surmounting the small roof.  Once you've reached the second bolt, the climbing eases down to 5.7 or 5.8 until the very last move.

The crux is hard and relatively un-fun, while  the remainder of the route is a completely different grade, and sorely lacking in character.

# Location
The first visible route once you've descended the initial set of switchbacks, on the Ponderosa Point rocks.  Only a couple hundred yards from the parking area.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchor...with at least one funky ring.
