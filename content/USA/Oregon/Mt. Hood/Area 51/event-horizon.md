# Description
A tall move, similar in nature to that of it's classic neighbor, "The Mothership," kicks off this slabby crimp/tech fest .  If you can't reach the two jugs above the first clip, you may be f'd.

If you can, what awaits is a delicate haul up sparse, small edges and pockets with the occasional use of the arete, and a lot of balance and nerve.

The crux hits around the 7th bolt, as you're forced off the arete and onto the face where a couple of pockets and 1/2pad crimps - just a little too far apart - await to thwart your redpoint.

This is an excellent, varied climb full of exciting, unique movement.  If you're climbing at the grade, it's a toss-up whether you'll find this or The Mothership more worthy.

# Location
Just to the right of The Mothership, the bolted line that ascends the very blunt/rounded arete.

# Protection
9 quickdraws, bolted anchors shared with Wormhole and Stargate.
