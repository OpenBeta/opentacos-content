# Description
A short, dirty climb that's over before you've had time to start hating it.  The moves to the first bolt feel a little insecure, but the rest of the climb is pretty straight forward.

# Location
Just to the right of "Luna."  Find the shady rise in the approach path, and the dirty water streak to the right of "Luna."  The bolt line goes up from there.

# Protection
Quickdraws and one or two midsized cams.  Bolted anchors.
