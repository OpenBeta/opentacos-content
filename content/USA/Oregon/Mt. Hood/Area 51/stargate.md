# Description
Stargate has the same start as Wormhole, up the offwidth crack.  At the ledge, half way up, bolt one of the anchors that are affixed there, and begin up the bolted inside face (just around the corner, and to the right of Event Horizon).  Follow three bolts above the midway anchors, and then merge at the last bolt with Event Horizon.  Anchors shared with Event Horizon and Wormhole.

The first few bolts of the second half of the route are spaced pretty far apart, and the crux comes early on that face.  It would be pretty easy to miss the first (or second depending on how you count it) bolt and deck on the ledge.

# Location
Jammed to the right of Event Horizon and left of Wormhole.  Shares the start of Wormhole and the end of Event Horizon.

# Protection
Gear to 3" for the first half.  Five quickdraws for the second.  Shares its fifth bolt and bolted anchors with the final bolt of Event Horizon.

There is signficant possibility of injury if you miss the first bolt beyond the midway anchor.  Proceed with caution!
