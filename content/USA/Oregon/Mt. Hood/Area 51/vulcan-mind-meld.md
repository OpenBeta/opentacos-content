# Description
A few easy bolts gets you under the roof.  A bit of thought (and maybe a fun heel hook) will get you out and around the lip onto the face.  The climb eases from there to the anchors.

# Location
The first route on the wall just before crossing the little bridge.  The route goes in and then up around the right side of the overhang.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchors.
