# Description
A fairly innocuous looking, left-leaning crack on the same face as Cattle Mutilation.   Great gear placements, solid feet and plenty of opportunity for hand jamming.

Though it doesn't look particularly different from the rest of the climb, the top 1/3 of the route gets more challenging.

# Location
About 3/4 of the way along the approach path. Wide-open face in the middle of the biggest clearing at the crag. Has a horizontal ledge half way up, and a left leaning crack on the right hand side of the face.  Climb the crack.

# Protection
Lots of mid-sized cams and nuts.  Bolted anchor, shared with Cattle Mutilation
