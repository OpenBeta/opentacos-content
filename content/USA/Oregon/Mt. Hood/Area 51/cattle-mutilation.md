# Description
A gutsy and demanding route, but it has style.  The first three bolts force exciting moves on crimps and underclings.

Attain the ledge, clip the fourth bolt and take a rest.

The fifth bolt is up and left on a face with a few very small crimps (one of the better ones is right below the bolt).  Don't miss this clip or you'll deck on the ledge.

The crux is the majority of the second face;  movement from the ledge through the sixth bolt on very small, hidden crimps.

# Location
About 3/4 of the way along the approach path.  Wide-open face in the middle of the biggest clearing at the crag.  Has a horizontal ledge half way up, and a left leaning crack on the right hand side of the face.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchor.
