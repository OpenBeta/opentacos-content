# Description
Super fun climbing, great trad placement opportunities.  Even a roof or two to pull!  Exciting stuff, especially if you haven't led too much trad before.

# Location
Left around the corner and up a small dirt hill from "Little Grey Men."  The appealing, hand crack up an otherwise unused face.

# Protection
Lots of cams!  Bolted anchors.
