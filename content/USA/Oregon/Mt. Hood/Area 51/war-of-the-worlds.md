# Description
I don't know if this route exists.  I will gladly take this route description down when someone tells me where this route really is, or if I have mistaken it with "Men in Black" next door to it.

# Location
The guide book says this route is in between Men in Black and Dreamland.  There's not much real estate between those two routes, and there is no bolt line.  The slabby face that works into an interesting diagonal overhang could be where the route was, and there are large pockets in the rock that might have housed bolts before they blew, but there's no safe climbing between these routes that I can see.

# Protection
