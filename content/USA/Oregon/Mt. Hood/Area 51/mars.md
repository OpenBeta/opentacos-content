# Description
Another of Area 51's most solid climbs!  Exciting moves on unique rock.  Plenty of opportunity to stem and even throw in the occasional jam...and even a couple of good rests built in.

Climbing the face, without using the dihedral (and, therefore foregoing the rests), raises the grade to 11b.

# Location
Located 2/3 of the way down the approach trail and features a left-facing dihedral with interestingly faceted, very RED rock.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchor.
