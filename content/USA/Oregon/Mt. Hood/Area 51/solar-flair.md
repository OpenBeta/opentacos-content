# Description
Delicate, pocket and crimp moves to become established on the arete, followed by easier climbing until you reach the last face.

# Location
Just past the little bridge, the left line on the obvious face.

# Protection
Quickdraws and one obvious, bomber placement for a 3" cam half way up.  Bolted anchors, shared with Sunspot.
