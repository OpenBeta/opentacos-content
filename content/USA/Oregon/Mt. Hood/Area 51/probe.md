# Description
An unpleasant climb.  The lower section features a wide, slimy (rat-poop smeared) offwidth crack that takes large gear and offers one bolt.

Once past the lower portion, the upper half is tough, unrewarding crimping and pinching on nondescript Area 51 crystals.

With such great routes as "Alien Observer" and "The Mothership" within 50 feet of this little abomination, it'll be tough to justify climbing this line.

# Location
To the right and across the gully from "Alien Observer." The rightmost climb in Pod #1.  Look for a route devastated by a large, wide offwidth crack for the first half, and a crystally upper face.

# Protection
Quickdraws and various cams, including larger ones for the offwidth crack at the beginning.
