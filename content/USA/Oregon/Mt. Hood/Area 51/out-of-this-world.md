# Description
A nice warm up route.  Easy climbing to the top of the detached block half way up.  The crux is crossing on to the sharp, slabby face before continuing to the anchors.  The second half feels a bit like sharper Smith Rock climbing.

# Location
First route left of "Rocketman."  Find the imposing tower that is the aforementioned behemoth.  To the left is an unimpressive 20 foot tall detached block with bolts running up the left face.  This is your route.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchor.
