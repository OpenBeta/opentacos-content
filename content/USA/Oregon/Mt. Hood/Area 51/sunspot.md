# Description
A fun, challenging and technical slab route!  Place a couple of cams near the start, continue up a thin face with reachy moves to a bulge.

Surmounting the bulge is the crux.  Once you know the trick, you'll love this route!

# Location
Just past the little bridge, on the same face (and using the same anchors) as Solar Flair.  The right bolt line.

# Protection
Quickdraws and midsized cams.  Bolted anchor.
