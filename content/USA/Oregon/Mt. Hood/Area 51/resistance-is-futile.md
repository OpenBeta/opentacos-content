# Description
A cool face climb requiring lots variety in technique to vanquish.  Jams, crimps, delicate/technical face moves, mantles and pockets.  It's all there, and much more entertaining than it appears.

# Location
Left-center of Pod 3 (the first alcove on the way in to the crag on the approach).

# Protection
7 draws, two thick Metolius hangers as an anchor.
