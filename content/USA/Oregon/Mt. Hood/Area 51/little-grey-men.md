# Description
Another of Area 51's physically demanding crimp routes.  Limber up those fingers and try to spot the holds ahead of time.  They're all here, just really hard to find while climbing!

Tiny ledges on grey rock (with the occasionally re-glued hold).  Sounds a bit dull until you're two clips up.

The movement is awesome, and finding those invisible ledges just before peeling off makes this route quite a rush, even if it is short.

# Location
The bolt line just across the dihedral from "Mars."  Located 2/3 of the way down the approach trail and features a dihedral with interestingly faceted, very RED rock on the right face.  The grey, left face is your route.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchor.
