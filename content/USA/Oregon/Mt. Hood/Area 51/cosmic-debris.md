# Description
A less than awesome 5.9 with some strange moves and not a whole lot to redeem itself.  If you're after a good warmup, you'll do better with "Out of this World," but this humble little route will do the trick too.

# Location
Left, and around a bulge from "First Contact."

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchors.
