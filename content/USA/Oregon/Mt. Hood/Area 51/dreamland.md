# Description
It looks easy, but the technical slab climbing on the first 2/3 of this route is no joke.  Following is a crux section pulling a lip on a small roof.  Finish the route on  one last slab section, veering left and into the crack just before the anchors.

# Location
Walk to the end of the approach path.  The second bolt line on the last slabby face before the trail ends in the "cave" area.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchors. (Shared with Young Jedi)
