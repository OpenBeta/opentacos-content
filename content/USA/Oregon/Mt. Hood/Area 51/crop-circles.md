# Description
A quality climb that offers a variety of climbing and amazing position.  Crop Circles ascends the arete with the blank streak running across it on the face.  The delicate and finger intensive crux comes at the beginning of the arete, but the final bulge at the top is no easy exit.  Lie backs, aretes, lunges, and face climbing; Crop Circles has it all, getting better the higher you go.

# Location
Towards the middle of the climbing area and about 8' right of Mars.

# Protection
Sport.
