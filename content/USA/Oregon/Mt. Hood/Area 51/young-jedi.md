# Description
Surmount an opening dihedral, work right over a small roof and onto the slabby face above.  What follows is technical slab work on a rock that has fewer holds than you'd expect, and much more lichen and moss than you'd want.  Route/hold finding is a bit of a challenge, and though the movement might seem novel, there's always something that makes the climbing less than enjoyable.

# Location
Walk to the end of the approach path. The first bolt line on the last slabby face before the trail ends in the "cave" area.  Look for the black hangers, five feet left of Dreamland, sharing the same anchors.

# Protection
About 6 bolts, janky 2-bolt chain anchor that will suffice for now, but isn't the easiest to clean from.  The Oregon Rock book suggests this is a mixed route that takes gear...but it's definitely adequately bolted.
