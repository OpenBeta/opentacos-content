# Description
Precise, delicate slab climbing on small, sharp holds.  Use the arete and small cracks where helpful, and place gear in a couple of the middle crack sections.

# Location
Just before crossing the little bridge, there's a face where the right side has a long crack on orange rock and three or four bolted lines.  Perpendicular to this wall and facing the bridge is a long, slabby, gnarled, grey face.  This is your route.

# Protection
Quickdraws and 3 or 4 midsized cams.  Bolted anchors.
