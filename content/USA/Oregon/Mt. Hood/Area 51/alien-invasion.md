# Description
A tricky start yields to easier climbing via a crack under a small roof.  This section handles gear from 0.1" to 2".  Swing left under/around the roof and clip the first bolt.  Place another piece and work up under the second roof, to another bolt.  Head left around the roof and onto the 5.8 slab through three more bolts.

On paper this all sounds fine.  The moves off the deck are what give it the grade, though, and they seemed challenging to protect.  Moreover, the route is infrequently touched, so it's a bit more crumbly and dirty than fun.  The slab at the top suffers the most, though the whole line feels somewhat less solid than it should.

# Location
On the edge of the approach path just inside Pod 2 (around the corner from Pod 1, where Alien Observer/Wormhole/etc. are located).

# Protection
Gear to 2" and quickdraws.  Two bolt hanger/anchor, with a couple of rusty chain links.
