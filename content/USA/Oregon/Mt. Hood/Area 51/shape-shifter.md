# Description
A unique and strenuous climb.  Pull into the route on some crimpy holds on undercut/poor feet.  The first two thirds of the route utilize a shallow dihedral and thin-to-non-existent hands with precise footwork.  Once out of the dihedral, the climbing eases.

# Location
Just to the left of "Luna," in a very shallow dihedral.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchor.
