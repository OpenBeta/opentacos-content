# Description
Climb up the technical start on the slab right of HAL, and then cross over HAL at the 3rd bolt. Stem your way up until you are forced onto the face. Surmount the bulge crux using creaky, glued on holds, and then continue up through multiple overhung glued on jugs to the anchor. Rather scary due to the glue.
