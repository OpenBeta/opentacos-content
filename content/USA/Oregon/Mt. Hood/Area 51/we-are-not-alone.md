# Description
Challenging moves off the deck on pockets and sidepulls give way to entertaining jug hauling and a rest stance.  The final moves surmounting the bulge aren't the crux, but they're tricky, awkward, and a lot less enjoyable than the first 2/3 of the line.

The Oregon Rock book suggests that the route goes at 10d, with an eliminate option of staying entirely right of the bolt line for the first two bolts, which goes at 11a.  The latter has a sneaky, committing move getting to second bolt...an attentive belayer, or a stick clip for the second bolt is advised.

# Location
On the edge of the approach path, ascending the blunt arete between Pods 2 and 3 (around the corner from Pod 2, where Alien Invasion/Abducted are located).

# Protection
Quickdraws, janky two-bolt anchor with chains, but only one hanger.
