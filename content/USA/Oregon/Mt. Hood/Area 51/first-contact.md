# Description
Fun, straight forward climbing.  Some small holds and some harder pulls, but a pretty representative example of Area 51's more moderate side.

# Location
Left and around the corner from "UFO."  The appealing looking wide, vertical face with lots of  Area 51 style crystals and small blocks.

# Protection
Quickdraws. Bolted anchors.
