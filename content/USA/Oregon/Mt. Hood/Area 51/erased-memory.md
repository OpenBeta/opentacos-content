# Description
Climb up a face with plenty of cracks for gear placements, and features that make for interesting moves.  Mixed bolts and gear will get you to the top of this fun, varied climb.

# Location
About 3/4 of the way along the approach path. Wide-open face in the middle of the biggest clearing at the crag. Has a horizontal ledge half way up, and a left leaning crack on the right hand side of the face.  To the right of this crack, and a little way around the corner from the main part of this face is where the route begins.

# Protection
Quickdraws and midsized cams.  Bolted anchors.
