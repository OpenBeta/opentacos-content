# Description
I don't know if this route exists. I will gladly take this route description down when someone tells me where this route really is, or if I have mistaken it with "Hoss" next door to it.

# Location
This is supposed to be the second visible route once you've descended the initial set of switchbacks, on the Ponderosa Point rocks, and it's supposed to share an anchor with "Hoss."  There is no visible second bolt line on that anchor, though!

# Protection
??
