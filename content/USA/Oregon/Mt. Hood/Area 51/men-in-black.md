# Description
A short and unpleasant route with moves that at some points feel like 5.9 and at other points feel like 5.11, but at no point feels fun.

Haul up over a lip to a strange arete/slab climb into a wide crack where you can find anchors...or don't.

# Location
To the right of "Dreamland" is a super slabby face.  At the right end of the slab, there's a lip and the rock becomes more vertical.  This is your bolt line.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchors.  This whole route looks like it was redrilled, and something feels wrong with just about every aspect of it.
