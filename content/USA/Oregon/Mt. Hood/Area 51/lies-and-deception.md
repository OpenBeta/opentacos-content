# Description
A difficult opening move gives way to a relaxed, wide crack.  Half way up the route, take a sit down rest, then launch into the bolted face climb.  The first two thirds of this bolted section climb a fantastic line of crimps and jugs through a shallow overhang.  Once you've pulled the lip, though, "Lies and Deception" earns its grade...and name...easily with a short but thin and technical finish on a surprisingly bald face.  Enjoy the whip!

Stellar movement, satisfying holds, and great bolt placement make this route another fantastic Area 51 climb!

# Location
In Pod #1, just left of Alien Observer, in the right hand side of the hollow where the "Wormhole" crack line is.  Look for a very low first bolt (probably clippable from your tip toes if you're tall).

# Protection
Cams protect the 5.9/10a crack for the first half of the route (up to 3").  Eight quick draws and bolted anchor (including the very low starting bolt).
