# Description
A blocky scramble kicks off this sustained beautiful face.  A few moves of low difficulty bring you the middle of the face and a no hands rest.  From here the route becomes very sustained with virtually no rests.  Sequential moves lead up edges to a seam that ends in either a deadpoint or more static beta to a sloping flat 'jug'.

More very sustained crimping leads through a tricky sidepull move and the crux crimping sequence.  A quality headwall finishes on flat edges and crimps and provides quite a healthy pump.

I found this route to be the best I did at the crag, even better than it's classic neighbor Mothership!

# Location
Immediately left of Mothership

Lots of draws, this guy is tall and well bolted
