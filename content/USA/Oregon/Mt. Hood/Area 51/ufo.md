# Description
Moderate climbing for the first couple bolts.  Once on the main face, however, the holds get small and clipping gets interesting.  The moves aren't particularly interesting, but the size of the holds makes this route exciting, and not necessarily in a good way.

# Location
To the left of Roswell, on the left edge of a cryastlly face.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchors.
