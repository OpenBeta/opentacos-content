# Description
A fun, blancy slab climb that ends with an easier section with a crack and overhang.  Great movement  on the first 2/3 of the route makes the whole thing worth it!

# Location
3/4 of the way down the approach path, past the open clearing where Cattle Mutilation's face is, and up a rise into the heavily shaded section of the path.  The main bolt line up the center of the slabby face.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Anchor is made with two bolts placed vertically and a chain connecting the two...one rap ring for the setup (?).  Not ideal.  Can traverse left and use the bolted anchor from "Shape Shifter" to rappel.
