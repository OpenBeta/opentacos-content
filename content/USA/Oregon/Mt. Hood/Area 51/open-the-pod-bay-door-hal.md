# Description
A cool trad line that constantly has you moving right.  The gear placement is decent, and the climbing is pretty good.  The route just seems to gradually get harder as you climb.

The crux is 10-15 feet from the top, where the crack straightens back to vertical in an awkward, slightly bulging, and definitely offwidth manner.  You'll be happy if you bring a 4" cam and save it to protect this section.

# Location
To the right of "Close Encounters" find the wide, right-leaning dihedral crack that doesn't have bolts going up it.  Should be right before the Mothership face.

# Protection
Lots of cams and nuts.  Save a large cam or two (3", 4") for the last 10 feet.  Bolted anchors.
