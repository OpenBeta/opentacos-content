# Description
A challenging route that utilizes small holds, imperfect crack holds and requires some good - and far less than obvious- decisions when finding a line.

The first half of the route climbs like a 5.11a in places, but once you reach the 2/3 mark (about at the top of "Vulcan Mind Meld," just to the left), the climb eases to 5.9.

# Location
The next bolted line to the right of "Vulcan Mind Meld."  Just to the right of the little bridge.  Look for the sport line with vertical cracks and a section of blacker rock 1/3 of the way up.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Bolted anchors.
