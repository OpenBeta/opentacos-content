# Description
Fun, delicate moves off the deck give way to easier climbing.  Great movement all the way up though.

# Location
Just to the left of "It Taint Human," and right of "Roswell."  It's on the arete with a couple pockets and a short but visible bolt line.

# Protection
Quickdraws and an obvious, bomber placement for one mid/large sized cam.  Bolted anchors
