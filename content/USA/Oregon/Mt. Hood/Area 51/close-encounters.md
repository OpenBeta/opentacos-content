# Description
Fantastic, challenging and varied climbing!  Delicate face moves, use of an arete, dynamic moves to crimps, an overhang section with blocky holds you can use multiple ways, this route is killer!

Begin on a thin, blank face, work your way up using sparse feet small crimps and the occasional arete pull.

Move into an overhang and pull the lip onto tiny crimps.

The first bolted anchor can be the endpoint here, or you can pull another roof to the final anchor

# Location
Around the arete to the right of "Alien Autopsy."

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Two sets of bolted anchors.  One 3/4 of the way up, another around a second roof.
