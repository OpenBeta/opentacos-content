# Description
A great climb that offers a variety of climbing styles.  Start with a few boulder moves to get over the large bulge onto the face.  Use nice hand cracks and thin crimps to get up to the crux at the small roof.  A heady leaning move off the ledge puts you on the exciting arete to the anchors.

# Location
Farther on down the wall on the other side of the small wooden foot bridge.

# Protection
Quickdraws
