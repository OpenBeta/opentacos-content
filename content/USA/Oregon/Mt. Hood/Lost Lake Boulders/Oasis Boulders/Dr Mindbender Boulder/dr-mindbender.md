# Description
SDS deep under the overhang doubled on the obvious slopey edge, with some less than stellar feet, toss right hand to good slopey edge on the lip and then up to a slimper (sloper with a crimp on it) with the left hand, followed by a right hand to the great jug rail and then on to the top.

Any feet not on this boulder are obviously off route (using the pebbles to the left or right of the overhang are off route).

# Location
On the Dr Mindbender Boulder, facing the road near the first parking spots.

# Protection
Pad
