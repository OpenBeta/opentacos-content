# Description
SDS on a hollow sounding slopey jug with really crappy feet under the roof or a heel hook and toss a long reach up and left for a decent edge (or you could probably go straight up to a big reach for another more hollow jug) and follow the easy line of edges up to the top and mantle.  Stand start on the decent edge and finish the route for a V0.

# Location
On the hanging face that faces the first parking spots at Lost Lake.
