# Description
Stand start on the arete on the left side of the Mirage Boulder, follow the good edges up and right away from the arete and onto the slab near the top to a slopey mantle and top out.  Great for beginners, with great edges and just enough height to thrill 'em while topping out!

This was an established problem, I gave it a name for practical matters...so if you know the correct name for the boulder and arete, please inform me and I will gladly change it to the correct info.
