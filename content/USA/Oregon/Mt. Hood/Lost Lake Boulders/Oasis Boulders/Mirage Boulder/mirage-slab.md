# Description
Stand start, step up onto the big edge on the slabby face and climb the slab and edges right of the Mirage Arete without using the arete...tops out the same as Mirage Arete but is more of a direct/straight up version.

Once again, this seems like it would have been an established route already, so please contact me if you have the correct name for the boulder and route and I will gladly change it.

# Location
This problem is just right of the Mirage Arete.
