# Description
Start by any means necessary, gain a juggy ledge and find a way to stand on it, from here the hold thin out and the rounding lip seems just out of reach. Commit to one or two moves on good feet and slopey hands to gain the top. Many ways to do this line, all are pretty fun. For a bonus point start on the south face.

# Location
Starts on the left side of the east face.
