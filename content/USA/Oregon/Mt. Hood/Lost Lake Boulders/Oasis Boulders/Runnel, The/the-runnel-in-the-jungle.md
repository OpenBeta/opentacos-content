# Description
Start on the far left of the overhanging face with your choice of crimps where the two boulders lean on each other. Traverse through the crimps in the seam to a big hold, make a big move into the runnel and mantle. Really fun moves on good rock.

# Location
This problem is kind of hidden as the back of the boulder is shrouded by trees and the face is short and overhanging. Just wander down and left into the Oasis from the road.
