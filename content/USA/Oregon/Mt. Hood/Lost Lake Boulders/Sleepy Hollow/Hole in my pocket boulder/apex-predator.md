# Description
The right arete on the boulder to the left of the Hole in my Pocket boulder is quite fun. Start can feel a bit awkward but quickly becomes quality movement as you ascend the arete, reach over the lip to gain good holds, move left on very dirty smallish feet and exit at you earliest convenience. The further left you traverse the easier the mantle will become.

# Location
Just to the left of the "Hole In My Pocket" boulder
