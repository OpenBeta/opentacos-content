# Description
Start sitting on a low juggy ledge, climb up and left to a left hand juggy pinch, hike your right foot and either reach for the vertical slot or go all the way to the jug. Get setup on sweet jugs, throw your left foot on and get established on the small easy slab, walk to the top. Very fun climbing. There is a low-low start but I felt it would not add any value to the movement or aesthetic.

# Location
Around the corner from "Scarred Kittens", in the corridor-ish area.

# Protection
2 pads is sufficient. The landing seems gnarly but its manageable.
