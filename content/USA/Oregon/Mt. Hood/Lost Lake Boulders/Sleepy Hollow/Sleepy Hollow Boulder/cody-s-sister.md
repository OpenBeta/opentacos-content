# Description
An alternate start to Royce's Mom. This may be a slightly better line as it climbs the whole undulating rail feature.

# Location
Starts about 10 feet to the right of Royce's Mom in a little pit. Start on a good juggy crimp and climb up and left following the rail feature via crimps and slopers with good feet. It joins Royce's Mom at the good sloper. This line is nice and sustained and the pump may prove to be the crux.

# Protection
Pad(s), A fall at the beginning could be bad as there is a deep pit directly beneath you.
