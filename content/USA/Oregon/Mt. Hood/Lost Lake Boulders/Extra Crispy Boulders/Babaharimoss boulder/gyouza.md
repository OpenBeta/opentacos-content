# Description
Somewhat a variation on A.M. Yoga but it does not feel forced or contrived. Instead of staying low and going left (as for AM Yoga) do a couple more moves to a big tooth-ish hold, from here bust left to the arete. Very fun movement on good stone.

# Location
Start sitting in the center of the face on a large triangular hold.

# Protection
pads
