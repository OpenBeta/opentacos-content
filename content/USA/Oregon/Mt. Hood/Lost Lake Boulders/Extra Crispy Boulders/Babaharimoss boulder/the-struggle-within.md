# Description
Same start and opening sequence as Gyouza but once you reach the "jug" shelf you match and bust out right through a big move to a pinch and a cool small tooth hold.

# Location
Starts in the center of the Babaharimoss boulder. Shares the same start as AM Yoga and Gyouza

# Protection
pads
