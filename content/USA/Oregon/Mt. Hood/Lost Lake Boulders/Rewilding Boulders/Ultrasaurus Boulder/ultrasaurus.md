# Description
Start sitting with left hand on the undercling and a right hand edge, move up and left with some powerful moves saving one of the best for the top out.

# Location
Maybe 100-150 yards strait up the hill from the marker on the road.

# Protection
A couple pads and a spotter would be nice.
