# Description
Climbs the center of the west face. Starts on obvious left facing sloping rail, climb up and left to a square pocket/jug via incut crimps, do a couple moves through more incuts to gain a ledge and another square jug. From here do a few long moves on good holds to gain the jug at the lip, get on the slab and enjoy the V-easy slab to the top. There is an obvious forced extension going left that rides a sweet juggy flake for another 15-ish feet and takes you into x-rated territory.

Down climb the south-east arete.
