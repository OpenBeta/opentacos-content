# Description
Start on the obvious ledge at the bottom left of the deep ghetto slot. Climb up and right through great holds, then move left at the end to climb out the "window" with a rewarding rockover.

# Location
Climb down into the pit below Prince of Persia. The ghetto slot contains a wall of edges and crimps on great stone. This is Point of Egress.

# Protection
Even with many pads and a spotter, this climb is difficult to protect. It should be approached as a highball. Falling off the very end would be bad.
