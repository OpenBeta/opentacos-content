# Description
Prince of Persia climbs out of the pit and on to the overhanging face. Climb down into the pit and start in the crack jug. The first few compression moves are static with some tricky beta, but take extreme care not to fall to your left. Continue with a series of pleasing deadpoints on edges, building to a final swing move to the horn. An easy rockover leads into the highball crack. Starting at the horizontal on the face is about V5.

# Location
Likely the first route you'll see in the Pit area. From the talus field, look for the highball crack. Then scramble up the boulders and find the built landing.

# Protection
Several pads.
