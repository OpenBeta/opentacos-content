# Description
This problem is located to the right of the diving board, and goes up the middle of the face.  You can start from either left or right of center.  The photo I included shows the problem starting from left.  Stand start with both hands on a crimp rail (Left Start), then use a series of side pulls, and  top out.  Some of those side pulls have great thumb catches!

# Location
The Keystone boulder is just above Rewilding boulder; it's a large block split into two, with a large diving board boulder on top of it.
