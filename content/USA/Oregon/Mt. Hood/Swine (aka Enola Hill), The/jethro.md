# Description
Jethro is the standard approach to the top of the obvious pillar on Enola's Moonshine wall. It's a decent route, but the real reason to climb it is to get to Jugalicious and the Second Pitch of Swine of the Times.

The first bolt is a little high, but shouldn't be too challenging for anyone comfortable with the grade.

# Location
Moonshine wall. The only line of bolts on the obvious pillar.

# Protection
6 QDs w/2-bolt anchor
