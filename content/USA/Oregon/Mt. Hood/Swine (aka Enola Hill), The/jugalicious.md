# Description
Big moves between overhung jugs. This one reminds me of most climbs at Ozone. Approach by climbing the first pitch of Swine of the Times or Jethro.

# Location
This is the right-trending line of bolts on the face above the prominent pillar on the Moonshine wall

# Protection
6 QDs and 2-bolt anchor at the top
