# Description
Use sidepulls and jugs to balance and power through the first part of the climb. The second portion of the climb ascends a minor buttress before navigating a small roof. This route seems more cryptic than the other 5.10 sport routes at Enola.

Watch out for a few rock between the start and the third bolt. I don't remember needing to use anything loose to climb this.

# Location
Stop just to the left of the first roof on your way down the trail. This is the first line to the left of the roof. This route converges with "Granny's Got a Gun" (5.12b roof route to the right) at the 5th or 6th bolt.

# Protection
9 bolts plus a 2-bolt anchor
