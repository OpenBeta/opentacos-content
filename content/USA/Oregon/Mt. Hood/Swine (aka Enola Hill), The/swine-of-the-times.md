# Description
Swine of the Times climbs to the top of the obvious pillar on the Moonshine wall to a 2-bolt anchor and then moves up and left through a fun series of sidepulls and jugs.

P1 starts in a hand-sized crack on the left side of the prominent pillar before merging with Jethro around the third bolt.

P2 Follows a line of bolts up and left from the pillar. Optional gear (1-2"?) protects runout jugs between the 5th and 6th bolts.

Descent: Climbers can lower off of the anchors to the ground with a 60m. You might be able to rap from the anchors with 60m. Our team sent the leader back to the top of the pillar using a QD attached to the belay loop. The follower lowered off of the fixed biners on the anchor.

# Location
This starts in the obvious crack up the left side of the prominent pillar on the Moonshine wall.

# Protection
P1: a few hand-sized pieces and 4 QDs; 2-bolt anchor

P2: 6 QDs and optional hand-sized piece; 2-bolt anchor
