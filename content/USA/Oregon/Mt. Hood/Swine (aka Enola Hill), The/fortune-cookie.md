# Description
Technical and fun, with the crux a little higher than the halfway point.  After the main crux move it is still on you for a few more until you get the victory jug to pull to the anchor. Trust your feet!  The mono-crimp is good, I swear.

Left hand rides the edge of Tipsy McStagger, with the right hand using holds on the seemingly blank face.

Can easily set up TR by climbing Jethro (10b) and traversing left to the anchors. Quite obvious once you see it.

Originally TRd by Tymun Abbot around 2010, I was able to get him back out to pick his brain about the area....and the stoke was reignited.  We came out, dialed the moves, marked our bolt spots, then the Estacada fires rolled in and smoked us out, followed by rain.  After a few weeks of pacing, we went out to finish up.  Tymun bolted the route and was gracious enough to let me give a redpoint burn on it after his first attempt.

# Location
Just right of the Tipsy McStagger crack.  15 feet left of Jethro (10b).

# Protection
6 bolts. Steel biners for anchor.
