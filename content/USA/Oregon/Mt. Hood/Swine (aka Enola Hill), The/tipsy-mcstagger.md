# Description
About ten feet left of the large pillar on the main wall (Moonshine Wall) is a conspicuous flared crack on a smooth face. Relatively easy, though dirty climbing leads to a corner that is capped by a three foot roof. Reach out from an undercling to place some tiny cams and get ready to do battle. Coming around the roof is intense though once established on the smooth face above there's a decent handjam. From a pair of flaring handjams, toss to good crimp and the ascent is in the bag.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Gear to 1".  You'll want one or two tiny cams for the crux.  I used a Metolius #00 and a BD C3 #0 above the roof.

Or

Easily top-roped by traversing over from the pilar or being lowered from Swine of The Times p2.
