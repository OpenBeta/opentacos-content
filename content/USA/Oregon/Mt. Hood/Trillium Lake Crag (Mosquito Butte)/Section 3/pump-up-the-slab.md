# Description
A really fun route that starts off pumpy and ends in a technical slab.

This route is another "Unknown name" which is annoying so I renamed it. I know thats bad style but hopefully it will help keep track of the routes better.

# Location
This is the second route to the left of the gully that separates sections 2 and 3.

The gully is 5.6, then a 5.8 sport route, then this route. the route to the left of this is a 10d.

# Protection
5 bolts to new anchors re bolted 2019
