# Description
The book says this is a 5.11a but itâ€™s 5.10a. This is a pretty fun route with some crack moves and side pulls and knobs. Not as pumpy as the routes to the right but enough to make you need to shake out mid route.

# Location
This route starts just before heading up the trail to the back wall. It is just to the right of the rock horn route.

# Protection
5 bolts to rap rings. This route would be hard to TR, but you could lead the 5.10 to the right or the 5.8 next to the gully crack and swing over.
