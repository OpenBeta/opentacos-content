# Description
A fun easy trad lead up a corner gully. Start in between 2 bolted routes and head up and left. You can clip 1-2 bolts from the route to the left if needed. You can stem in the start and then climb a few slabby face moves with crack pockets for pro (thin pro and slightly run out) then throw a cam in a horizontal towards the top into a nice handjam and up to the anchors.

I spent a lot of time cleaning this route, it looked like it had never been climbed before. I knocked down a ton of loose rocks and brushed off a lot of moss. It still needs some more work, but its good to go now.

# Location
Big gully separating section 2 and 3.

# Protection
Standard single rack. Nuts, small cams and #2 and #3 to a new anchor re bolted in 2019.
