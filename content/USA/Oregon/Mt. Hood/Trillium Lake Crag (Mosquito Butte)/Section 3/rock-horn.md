# Description
This route climbs the eye-catching rock horn with a distinctly overhanging finish.

Ascend mediocre but easy climbing following a funky crack to a stance just before the clean face. The gear here is questionable but the climbing is pretty easy (offset cams/nuts would probably work best). Once at the overlap, a good small cam can be placed to protect the moves up to the first bolt.

Once clipped, work your way up the pumpy face to a decent stance before tackling the unique horn finish.

# Location
Overhanging rock horn. Can't miss it.

# Protection
Small nuts and cams. Offsets would be useful.
