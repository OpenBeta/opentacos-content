# Description
Overhung rock tower with rock horn finish. Sparse start leads to easier, but pumpy, sidepulls and slopers to an arÃªte finishing crux.

Belay spot is sloping dirt. There's a handy tree for the belayer that also could be in the fall line for a climber on top rope. You could also maybe pendulum into the wall on the left, but my biggest challenge was getting back to the wall.

# Location
Far left of Section 3 to the right of the big, dark, offwidth. Anchors at the top of the left of two rock horns.

# Protection
7 bolts. Chains. There's a bolt for getting to the anchors for toproping.
