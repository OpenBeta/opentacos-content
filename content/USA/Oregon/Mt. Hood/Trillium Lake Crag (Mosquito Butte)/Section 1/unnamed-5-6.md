# Description
Described in the 2018 Holzman book, but not in Olson's. Definitely mossy and gritty, but bolts are shiny, tight, and very close together.

First summer I've climbed outside, but I don't know: the bouldery start and blank spot in the middle were stout for a 5.6.

Route bangs a hard left at the small cave at the top. Stay in the left of the "cave," clip the bolt above it, and traverse left to the anchors. The anchors are just around to the left. There's a bolt from another route at foot level.

The anchors can be reached from above, and you can set up a top rope safely if you use a sling around a small tree, but rope drag and pendulum falls are a thing here. You might have better luck than I did by extending the TR anchor with rope, but it's probably best to just lead this, rappel the natural fall line to the left, and top rope one of the other climbs.

# Location

# Protection
6? bolts. Anchors at the top.
