# Description
Arête climb Bolts are left of arête, and there's a far amount of face climbing. Cruxes at start and last 1/3.

# Location
First bolted route on the first wall. Two anchors up top. This uses the anchor for the adjacent route on climber's left and there's a redirect bolt. Anchor and bolt can be reached from above, but there's considerable dirt, pebbles, and moss up there. Anchors looked older and less reliable than others at the crag.

# Protection
5 bolts, Anchors + chains.
