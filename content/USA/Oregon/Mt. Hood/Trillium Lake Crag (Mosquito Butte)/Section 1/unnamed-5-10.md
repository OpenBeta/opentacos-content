# Description
Scant feet and sloping hands give a crux off the deck, then fun sustained movement. Rest is a little higher than you think! Second, harder, crux is getting the chains on small holds.

# Location
Middle of first wall. Shares first bolt with 5.9 on climber's left.

# Protection
5 bolts. Anchor with chains.
