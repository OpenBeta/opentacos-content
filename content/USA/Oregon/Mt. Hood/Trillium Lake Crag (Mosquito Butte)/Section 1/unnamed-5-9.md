# Description
Another short, solid, Trillium face climb with crux off the deck. Slim feet and hands at the start give way to consistent holds to the chains. The more you walk up the dirt first, the easier it is!

# Location
Leftmost route on the first wall. You can safely reach anchors from above, though, like all routes here, there is a fair amount of loose dirt at the top of the crag.

# Protection
5 bolts. Anchors with chains.
