# Description
Anchors at the top of a very mossy slab. Doesn't seem to see much traffic. Your choices are: rap in from a tree anchor to set a TR; highball boulder the moss; scrub the moss and boulder; or climb something else. I'd vote for the last option.

# Location
In the right sub-section of Section 2.

# Protection
Rusty chains. No bolts. Maybe there are cracks for gear under the moss, but I doubt it.
