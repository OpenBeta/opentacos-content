# Description
Start on some good jugs for 2-3 bolts and then head up an easy featured slab and top out on a small ledge. This is a nice spot to hang out and belay your partner up.

# Location
Far left of section 2. Section 2 is the main wall in center with the bench. Go left around the little arete and itâ€™s right next to a gully crack.

# Protection
5 bolts to new rap rings
