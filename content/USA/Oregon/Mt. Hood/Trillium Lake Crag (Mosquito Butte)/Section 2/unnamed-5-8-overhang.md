# Description
Fun moderate with an overhung start. The crux is low, but the first two bolts are easy enough to clip. No rest immediately after the overhangâ€”keep going. Rest of the route is more like 5.6 and mossy, but still fun.

# Location
Far left side of Section 2 wall before the ravine separating 2 and 3.

# Protection
5 bolts, anchors. There is a bolt high above for lowering down to setup a TR.
