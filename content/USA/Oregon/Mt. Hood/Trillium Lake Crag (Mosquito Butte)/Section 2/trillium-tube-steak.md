# Description
New route I bolted 10/23. It looked like it was going to be a fun 5.8 arete but it’s way easier at like 5.4. It will be a good easy warm up or a nice first lead. You could rap off a tree to get down to the anchors to TR it but it’d be easier to just lead it.

# Location
Just to the right of the main slab. There’s a small maybe 5.0 missy gully and it’s just to the right of that. Next to the mosssy 5.3.

# Protection
3 lead bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with quick links. All stainless bolts.
