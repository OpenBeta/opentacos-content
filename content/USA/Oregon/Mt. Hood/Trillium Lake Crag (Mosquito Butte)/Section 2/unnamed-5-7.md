# Description
Straight-ahead easy/moderate Trillium route. Like it's neighbor to the right, decently safe lead falls for an easy route. Biggest moves through the first two bolts, middle cruise, then slabby spice to the last bolt. There are plenty of crimps above the slab, but the big holds aren't as good as they look.

# Location
Middle of main wall. Anchors are safely reachable from above.

# Protection
Chains, 5 bolts
