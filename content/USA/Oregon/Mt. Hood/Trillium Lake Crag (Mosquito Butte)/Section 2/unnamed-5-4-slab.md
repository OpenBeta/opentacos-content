# Description
It's a short slab with merciful bolting. A good intro to outdoor climbing or leading. Lots of holds and never steep, though hands are a bit sloping for a 5.4.

# Location
Far right route of Section 2. Kind of on its own with a second set of anchors between Sections 1 and 2.

# Protection
4 bolts. Chains.
