# Description
This is the route on the very far left of the back wall. The start is some what tricky to protect so you might wonder around a little bit. But head straight up and out on the arete, clip a lone bolt half way up then throw in a #3 or #4 in a wide crack above you and continue up the arete to the anchors.

# Location
Far left side of the back wall with 1 bolt on the face.

# Protection
Single rack, small stuff for the start and a #3/4 for the top and 1 bolt. New rap ring anchor replace 2019. You can rap off a tree to set this up to TR it.
