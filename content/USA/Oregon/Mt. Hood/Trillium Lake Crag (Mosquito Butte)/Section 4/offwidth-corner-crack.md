# Description
A fun little off width corner crack. It’s fairly easy and doesn’t require much off width technique. It’s listed as 5.9 in the book but I’d say more like 5.7.  It takes some small gear inside but a #5 is nice at the top. I added anchors to this route so you wouldn’t have to top out into the loose dirt at the top. Also you can TR 2 other routes off the new anchors.

# Location
On the back wall this is the crack in the corner all the way to the right. Right next to the rock horn route.

# Protection
Standard rack. A number 5 and 6 can be used at the top or you can climb left and throw some smaller stuff in.

If you want to TR it you can rap in off a tree or a single bolt at the top.
