# Description
Great route! Sustained side pulling is the game here. Though it can be done in 2 pitches, it is recommended to do it as one continuous climb. Super pumpy and a classic!

(70m rope & 20 quickdraws needed to do this in 1 Pitch.)

# Location
Long bolted line just to the right of Shaken.

# Protection
20 bolts
