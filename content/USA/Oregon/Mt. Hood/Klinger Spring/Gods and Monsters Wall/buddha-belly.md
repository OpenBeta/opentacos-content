# Description
Second Pitch option for "In Godzill We Trust", this juggy sport route is overhanging most of the way, yet the large holds make it pretty moderate climbing... until you reach the overhanging "Buddha Belly" roof. Combine this route with "In Godzilla We Trust" as a single pitch to climb what is called "Godzilla VS The Buddha"
