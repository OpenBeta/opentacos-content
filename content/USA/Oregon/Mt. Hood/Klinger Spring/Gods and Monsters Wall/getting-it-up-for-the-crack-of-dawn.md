# Description
This long, continuous crack hosts an awesome route! A non-stop crack climbing challenge with mostly fingers & smaller terrain. It can be broken into two pitches, but is direct and vertical enough to do as one. Two rappels is the recommended descent to avoid the chimney down-climb.

# Location

# Protection
Gear to 3", doubles in 0.75-1.25" (BD 0.4-0.75) and nuts!
