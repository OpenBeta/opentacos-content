# Description
Trapped in Time: Second pitch to Monster Crack. An excellent looming crack that has everything from fingers to beautiful hand jams. Hopefully Ben will establish pitch 1 to this Gem of a climb at some point!

Medussa (5.9+): Variation of Trapped in Time. Do the first 5 moves of T.I.T. then follow small crack up & left to shared anchors. Tricky fingers.

# Location
Above Monster Crack.

# Protection
Standard rack
