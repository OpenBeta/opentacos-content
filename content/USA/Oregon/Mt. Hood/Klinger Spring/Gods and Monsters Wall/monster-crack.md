# Description
This route climbs a dihedral on the right side of a leaning, detached tower (Goddess of Virtue climbs the face of the tower). The crack you will be climbing is actually the space between this tower and the main face. The crack continues to get wider as you move up, to the point where you tunnel through the crack and reach the top of the tower.

# Location
Just right of Goddess of Virtue

# Protection
gear to 3" (optional 4" or 5" cam)
