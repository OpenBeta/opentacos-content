# Description
Continuous 5.9 crack climbing for over 110 feet! Very small seam to start, with tricky climbing for the first 20'. Crack widens to fingers & hands and eases up a bit. Widens to fist jams at 90' where you pull a small roof and continue up the widening fissure to Arm-bars at the anchors. You need a 70m rope to desend, (or use Monster Crack's anchors for 2nd Rap).
