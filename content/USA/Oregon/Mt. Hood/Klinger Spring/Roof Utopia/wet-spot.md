# Description
Thoughtful moves to the finishing crux roof.  This crux has seen a lot of airtime and there are several options for surmounting--bold direct, sneaky left, something in between.  Any way you go will be exciting.  Shake off the adrenaline and head for the anchors.

# Location
Obviously discolored (wet spot) area 30' right of Delicate Sound of Falling.  Last route to dry and the first to get wet.

# Protection
QDs (10-12?)
