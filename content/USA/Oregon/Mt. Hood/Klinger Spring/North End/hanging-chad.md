# Description
Don't let the short stature of the initial crag climb fool you, without the proper commitment to first 10' you will indeed be...hanging chad. The route sports weird features and spooky sounds--a worthy gateway to the Land of Shadows.

# Location
First route you will come to as the trail meets the cliff. Look for angled flakes with bolts just left and above.

# Protection
6 bolts + anchor
