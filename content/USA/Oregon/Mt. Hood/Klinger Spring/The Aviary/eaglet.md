# Description
This is the route leading up to the big roof. Please start close to the base of the Kestrel route and tiptoe across the blocks at the bottom leaving the vegetation in tact. The route rolls up an easy slab to a small roof above the 4th bolt and the crux, after a bit more you arrive under the massive roof and a set of anchors.

# Location
After leaving the dense woods it is the first big roof in the clearing.

# Protection
9 bolts, rap anchor under the roof with Mussey hooks.
