# Description
Well bolted beginner route with a non traditional start move. Side pulls, under clings, lay backs.

A little background: on my forays up to Cooper Spur I would call out to what I thought was an owl hooting at me; four hoots and I would respond with four, this would go on until I couldn't hear anymore 1/2mi or more away. Turns out it was a Blue Grouse and it is their mating call; no wonder they kept up so long!

# Location
On the same column as Felsschl√ºpfer just to climbers right.

# Protection
11bolts with Mussey Hook anchor.
