# Description
A bit difficult above the first bolt, crux is just above the fourth bolt where the feet get bad, and then a bit of a burn getting to the anchors. This is the bird I named my daughter after, one of my favorites while climbing, joyfully darting around the cliffs.

# Location
Just to the right of Osprey

# Protection
10bolts with Mussey Hook equipped anchors.
