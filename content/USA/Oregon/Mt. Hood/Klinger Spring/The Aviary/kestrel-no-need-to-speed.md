# Description
The route can be climbed a number of ways giving various difficulties. The first crux is at the 6' plate going straight up is a balancing act and crimpy, (difficult for shorter folks) the top has various lines and ranges from low to high 10. As always if you are in the moss you are off route. The first ascencionist got a speeding ticket driving home(and no it was not me this time).
