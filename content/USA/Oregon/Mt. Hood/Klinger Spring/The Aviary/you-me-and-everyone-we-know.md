# Description
Clip the first glue-in bolt pointing down on a roof, then pull over it via a right hand finger crack, revealing fifteen meters of .10- climbing to a good rest below an attractive, just off vertical blank slab. There are potentially several ways through this obstacle, but if you climb directly through the slab instead of sneaking left or right of this offset, give yourself a cookie.

I climbed this recently about a year after the FA. I think in retrospect that this might be .10+. I'm interested in other opinions of the grade. My sense is that it's sort of soft at .11-, but it's not inaccurate to label it thus.

# Location
Just right of Blue Grouse. Easily discerned by the glue-in first bolt pointing almost straight down in a two foot wide roof

# Protection
12? glue-in bolts
