# Description
A solid climb, featuring a burly start down low, and a seemingly never ending crimpfest up higher. The climb starts at a small roof with a high handhold next to a crack, and pulls straight up the crack to the first bolt. Work your way up the arÃªte, using sidepulls, crimpers, slopers and nasty foot smears.

# Location
3rd bolted route to the right of the leaning blocks.

# Protection
13 bolts?
