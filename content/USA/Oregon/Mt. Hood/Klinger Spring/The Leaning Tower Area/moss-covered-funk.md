# Description
Pumpy from the start, the crux nevertheless is towards the top with stemming and finger jams through an overhanging section of the crack.

The route finishes up on a cap-stone with shared anchors with Equinox.

Tie a knot in the end of your rope if not using a 70m rope.

# Location
Second crack to the right of Solstice, and just to the left of Equinox.

# Protection
Cams to 2.5"
