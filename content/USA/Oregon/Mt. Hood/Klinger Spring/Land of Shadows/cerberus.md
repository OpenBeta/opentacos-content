# Description
Worthy route in the Land of Shadows. Like its namesake guarding the gates of Hell, this route has three heads. If you like mixed do the 5.9 trad start on the left, middle variation is 5.9 sport, the right is mixed and can take a bite out of you at 5.10a. All the routes meet about midway with bolts, not to be taken lightly all the way to the shared anchor.

# Location
currently the third bolted route to the right of where the trail meets the cliff. Look for two separate bolt lines heading up and meeting about 50' up.

# Protection
10 bolts?
