# Description
This distinctive line starting below a hanging garden of andesite blocks appears much harder than it is. Start centrally below these chandeliers, wrestling steep moves on an array of massive underclings and sidepulls that transitions to easy edging on garden-variety Klinger terrain above.

Please help extend the life of the Euro-anchor by rapping.

# Location
A distinctive cave-like outcrop with many large vertical block roofs. It's the only route with an overhanging start in the area.

# Protection
11 glue-in bolts to a euro-anchor

For whatever reason, euro-anchors confuse the heck out of some climbers as there is only one rap ring. The rig is exceedingly safe (safer than side-by-side bolt anchors) as it it can't extend if one bolt fails. It's made entirely out of 304 stainless steel.

Use your own hardware to top-rope as you always would, then rap off. The ring is welded directly into the bottom hanger, making replacement a real pain. Help maintain the longevity of the ring by not lowering off and not top-roping through the rap-ring.
