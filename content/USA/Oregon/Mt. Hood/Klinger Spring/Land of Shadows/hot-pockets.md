# Description
Start at the top of a mound of dirt and moss. Easy face climbing dappled with shallow cracks until a thought provoking technical finish. Don't pull on the chains without looking for salvation in the moss!

# Location
Bolted route about 40' to the right of Hanging Chad (2nd bolted route you will see from where the trail meets the cliff.)

# Protection
8 bolts?
