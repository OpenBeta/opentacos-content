# Description
Crux is the 1st 10 feet.  Use a painful pinky eater, some edges, a lieback, and a high step to overcome the crux.  The rest of the climb is exponentially easier, but bring your crack climbing repertoire.  PG13 if you don't protect the roof down low (~6' fall to the ground), major rope drag if you use protection.  Aiding the crux will change the grade to 5.4 (C1).  Alternatively, can traverse in from Jugular Vein (5.9).

# Location
Starts on the right side under the same overhang as Jugular Vein.  I left anchors to rap from or walk off like the first ascensionists.

# Protection
Bring wide stuff (5") or run it out!
