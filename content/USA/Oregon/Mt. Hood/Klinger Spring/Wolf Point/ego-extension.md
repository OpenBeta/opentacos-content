# Description
Pull through three mini roofs that will generate a healthy pump from the steepness of the route and continue to a ledge and up a bolted pinnacle. The 5.10+ grade is without using the right side crack. If you use the crack for your right handholds, it comes in at 5.10-. Shares anchors with an 5.11a on the face on the left side of the arete.
