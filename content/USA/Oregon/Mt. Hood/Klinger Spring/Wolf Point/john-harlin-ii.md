# Description
A crimpy climb that starts on the left side of a tall arête with 3 small roofs on the right side. The route goes up the left face of the arête. Route is graded for the face holds only, without using the mossy and dirty crack on the left side (5.10- is the approximate grade if you use the crack for left handholds).  A solid crux comes in between bolts 5 and 7, with a pump-fest to the top of a large ledge. From the ledge, cross over and climb the last 25 to the anchors on a bolted pinnacle. Shares finish and anchors with Ego Extension 5.10+.
