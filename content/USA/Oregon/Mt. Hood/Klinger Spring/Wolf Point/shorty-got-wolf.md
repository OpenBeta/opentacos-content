# Description
Follow a nice steep crack system to a loose looking area with minimal protection (can sling a horn or two, or run it out on easy climbing) followed by more steep climbing through fun varied crack sizes.  Everything is there when you need it.  Still a bit dirty, definitely climbable--will likely get easier as it cleans up.  Section from about 10-20 is a bit loose and hard to protect and is the reason for the R rating--but easy climbing (FA was done w/o gear in this section).
