# Description
Done on a lark, because of the close proximity of the Ego Extension bolts.  Exciting 5.8 climbing through several diabolically small roofs.  Use the same anchors as Ego Extension. Everything is on, FFA was done all on gear...yes, even the last 15'.

# Location
Crack between Ego Extention and GSR

# Protection
Double rack to 5".
