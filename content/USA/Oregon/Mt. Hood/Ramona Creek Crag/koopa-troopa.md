# Description
A short section of faceholds and finger crack leads to an amazing perfect-hands splitter with a crux moving from a pod into a short section of thin hands/ringlocks.

# Location
Visible in the woods just after crossing Ramona Creek on a small wooden bridge.

# Protection
A single set of cams from fingers to #3 camalot. Take extra hand sized gear if you want to sew it up.

Lower from bolt with rap ring at the top of the crack (stay right).
