# Description
The route is up for options on the grading but I see a V5 as fit. Using the arete for all of your left hand and foot moves and 2 right handed moves this problem involes a bit of everything. Crimp, heal hook, edging, partial dyno.

The crux involves 2 moves. 1st crux matching right foot to left involves tight core as well as flagging. 2nd crux is the 2nd to last move which comprises of a dynamic right hand throw to an slopper. Great rock quality noting flakes. The last crux to a while to figure out becuase there seemed to be a better option which involved a dyno to the last hold.

# Location
Facing the crag this boulder is located below the schree pile farthest to the right. Its hard to give detail on location because the area isn't that mapped. But Boulder is about 15ft

# Protection
we used one pad and one spotter but 2 pad would be better
