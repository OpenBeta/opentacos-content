# Description
This is a fine route that opens up spectacular views of the Reid glacier and inspiring views of Yokum Ridge.

While technically it doesn't require much more skill than the southside route, the Leuthold's couloir route entails crossing some crevassed terrain and avalanche prone slopes.

The usual start is the same as South side routes. As you pass the Silcox hut begin to gradually trend left heading towards llumination saddle formed by a large noticeable rock on SE side of Mountain. After crossing over the saddle drop down onto the Reid glacier. As you drop down traverse to the right toward Yokum Ridge. Pass several couloirs on the right until you basically hit the steep wall of Yokum ridge. Once there turn right and enter into Leuthold couloir proper. Follow the couloir as it narrows and winds up the mountain. As the couloir ends and opens up continue up easy slopes to the summit ridge and onto the summit.

Descend down south side route.
