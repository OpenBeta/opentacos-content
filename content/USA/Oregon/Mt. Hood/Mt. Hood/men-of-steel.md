# Description
Men of Steel meanders up a system of gullies to ascend the main face of the Steel Cliff at a moderate grade.  The top of the route connects with the Wy'East route (and other variations), which can be followed to the summit proper; alternatively, one could downclimb back to Devil's Kitchen in a variety of ways, such as DKH V3/V4 (Flying Buttress, East Crater Wall).

Begin the route in a gully on the right side of the prominent "rock blob" at the bottom of the Steel Cliff (an alternate start comes in from the left).  From the top of the rock feature, follow gullies up and left towards the crater rim, passing several steeper sections of ice along the way.  Passing the final steep section to the ridge may be the crux; exiting left may be the best course of action, information about this route is limited.

This route should be climbed when the Steel Cliff has a good thick layer of solid rime ice.  Protection may be sparse.

# Location
Right in the middle of the Steel Cliff, approach via Devil's Kitchen.

# Protection
Ice Screws, Pickets.
