# Description
This is a great, relatively easy route up Mount Hood, avoiding the crowds of the South Side and catching great views of Adams, Rainier, and St. Helens along the way.

From Cloud Cap on the North side of Mount Hood, ascend the Timberline Trail to the moraine and continue toward Cooper Spur until reaching a large cairn.  Follow the climber's trail down to the Eliot Glacier.  Cross the glacier and head for the Snow Dome, ascend the dome and continue past Anderson Rock, trending up and right looking for a snow bridge to gain the ridge or a traverse over to gain it.  Climb the ridge to the summit.

If the road to Cloud Cap is open, you'll be able to cut off nearly 4 miles and a bit over 2,000ft of elevation on the Tilly Jane trail.
