# Description
P1 (55 meters) has two variations

Left side: Climb a pitch of standard, fun WI3 to join the upper ramp. It looks like WI2 from below but is steeper than it appears.

Right side: Climb a short ice/mixed section right off the glacier, which leads to a long ice traverse and joins the left variation.

After the pitches join, traverse hard left into the bottom of the snow gully that is visible from the base of the route.  Depending on the location of your belay you’ll reach the upper ramp in under 60 meters. Having the leader continue up the ramp as far as possible enables you to top out onto the North Face Cleaver in just one more pitch.  Belay in the snow gully.

P2 (60m): Climb up the snow field, then climb ice/mixed directly above the snow.  Where the ice ends, traverse right on dry garbage rock, with large exposure to the left.  After this the route joins with the top of The Pencil, with a short bit of ice climbing before a belay.

P3 (60m): Climb up and traverse left around the corner on snow and easy rock over several minor ridges, aiming for the top of the Right Gully route.

P4 (30m): One more short easy pitch on snow and crumbly rock leads to the snow fields at the top of the Right Gully ice pitches.

From the end of P4, continue up ~500 vertical feet of snow, ice, and easy mixed to the summit.  This portion of the route is shared with Right Gully, Ravine, and The Pencil.

# Location
On the west face of the North Face Cleaver, starting around 10,000 ft.  Approach from the upper Eliot Glacier, either from below (Cloud Cap) or traverse in from the top of the Sunshine route after coming up the south side.

# Protection
Ice screws (including stubbies), a few cams 0.4-1, small set of nuts.  Pitons may be useful, although they were not used on the FA.
