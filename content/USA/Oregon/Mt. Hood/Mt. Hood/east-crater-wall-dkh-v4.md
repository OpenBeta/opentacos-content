Pickets will only hold a fall if the snow and alpine ice is consolidated. Free soloing may be your only option. A fall would be very bad here and could potentially land one in the Devils Kitchen Fumerol which is over 100 feet deep and has poisonous fumes. Once on the ridge an un-arrested fall would be fatal. The W'Yeast Ridge only takes that would stop a fall in the best of conditions.
