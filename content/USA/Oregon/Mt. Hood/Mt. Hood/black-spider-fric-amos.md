# Description
The Fric-Amos climbs the left side of the Black Spider wall on the east face of Mt. Hood.  It contains 3 pitches of ice and mixed, separated by large snowfields and gullies.

P1: Climb the steep ice drip on the left side of the first rock band.  This pitch gets a lot of sun and may not always be in climbable condition.

P1 variation: Climb the narrow ice gully on right end of the first rock band.

Climb the large snowfield to the top end at the base of the obvious 2nd pitch.

P2: The money pitch!  Climb the steep ice line from the top left corner of the snowfield.  This is a full 60m pitch of sustained steep ice and mixed.

Climb the snow gully above the second pitch towards the rock band above and right.

P3: Climb a short ice step on the right side of the rock band to gain the upper snow slopes.  Variations may exist in this area.

Climb the snow gully above P3, which bears left and joins the Wyeast Ridge route shortly before the summit.

Note: This route, like all routes on the Black Spider, gets direct morning sun.  P1 variation and P2 are somewhat shaded due to being in corners, so they may fare better than other routes on the face.  Choose a cold day and be vigilant about conditions and overhead hazard.

# Location
Black Spider wall on the east face of Mt. Hood.  Can be approached from Timberline, Meadows, or Cooper Spur.  Cross the bergschrund at the top of the Newton Clark glacier to the base of the route around 10,000 ft.  This route is on the left side of the Black Spider amphitheater, and can be distinguished by the large star-shaped snowfield between the first and second pitches.

# Protection
8-10 ice screws (including stubbies), small rock rack, a few pitons
