# Description
This variation of Devil's Kitchen Headwall had less steep ice than the normal route(s), and allows for the climber to complete the upper portion of the Wyeast route, including the exposed gendarme and steep snow crux sections.

Follow moderate snow or easy ice up the gully towards what looks like a dead end headwall from below.  Near the top, turn right up the obvious snow ramp, which brings you to the crest of the Wyeast ridge.  Turn left and follow the ridge, through a small saddle (DKH V2 joins here), past the short traverse section (may be the crux) and up and right through moderate to steep snow (lots of exposure above the east face here) which eventually eases leads to the summit.

# Location
This is the 3rd significant couloir in the Devil's Kitchen headwall area when looking from left to right from Devil's Kitchen.  Pass the large fumarole on the right, then angle up and right through the basin to the bottom of the route.

# Protection
2 tools or 1 tool and 1 axe.  Pickets and a couple ice screws (if you plan on pitching it out)
