# Description
Large basalt/rhyolite wall located on the East side of Mount Hood with 35+ traditional routes ranging from 5.6 to 5.11+.
There are lots of nice cracks here that take protection very well. A standard rack will do the trick on most all the routes.
Pay attention to the wood signs that point out the Non-Climbing areas. DO NOT CLIMB IN THESE AREAS! This is due to an endangered plant species and there is a good relationship between the NFS and the climbing community.
