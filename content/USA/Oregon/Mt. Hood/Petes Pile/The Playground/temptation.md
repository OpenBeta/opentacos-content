# Description
Bushy start with the crux about 25 feet up. Upper half is difficult to protect, although you can place gear in the crack about 5 feet to the right and sling it. Almost run out in sections, but solid holds make it less sketchy.

# Location
Find the bushiest part of the Playground and start there . . . Second to last route on the Playground.

# Protection
Standard rack. Anchors at top.
