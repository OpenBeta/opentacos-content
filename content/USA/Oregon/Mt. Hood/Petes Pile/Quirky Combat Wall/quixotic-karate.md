# Description
A good mix of tight stemming and hands. Avoid touching the hugh chockstone by stemming around it.

# Location
The very end of the Quirky Combat wall, just before the trail turns the corner and enters a pristine undevelopped realm.

# Protection
Doubles from fingers to C4 #3, 1x C4 #4. A C4 #5 is useful, but perfectly optional. Offset nuts are useful.
