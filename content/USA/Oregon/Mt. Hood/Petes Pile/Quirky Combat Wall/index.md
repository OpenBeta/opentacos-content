# Description
Keep going left of K9 Shangai for about 150 yards. The faint trail follows the edge of the wall until you get to the next group of scrubbed routes.

The trail is on slopping very soft dirt and it does not take much to trigger a slide. Thread lightly.

All these routes are fairly new and even though great care was take to remove obvious loose rocks, some more may still be present. Helmets are strongly recommended. Some of these new routes might be in need of a light re-scrubbing. You should find brushes in the tree-mounted box along the trail. You are welcome to take one with you during your visit.
