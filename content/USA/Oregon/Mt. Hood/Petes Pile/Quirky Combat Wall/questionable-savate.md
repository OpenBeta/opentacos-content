# Description
Cross the jungle to reach the wall, but leave the belayer on the trail. Good jams, stems, and one improbable looking roof.

The anchor is far to the right, 23m long. A 60m easily gets you down.

# Location
About 30 yards left of Queasy Tai Chi, start where a big tree offers a solid plateform after a fairly narrow section of loose trail.

# Protection
Doubles from thin fingers to C4 #2. Singles of Black Totem and C4 #3.
