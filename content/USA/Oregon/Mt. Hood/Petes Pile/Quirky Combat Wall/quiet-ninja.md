# Description
Good mix of stemming and bomber finger jams on solid rock.

p1: 5.10b, 22m, head straight up doing mostly finger moves.

p2: 5.10b/c, 22m, head up on the dual crack system, bridging with stems when the cracks gets too thin for fingers.  Keep going until you reach the large ledge.

p3: 5.10a, 17m, up the v-slot, turn right at the bush, get on top of the column, top-out anchor on the far wall.  Pro is a little finicky.

Since p3 is not as good at the first two pitches, you might elect to rap from there.  If you top out after p3, there is another set of rap anchors on the ledge 10 meters right from where you top out that will merge with the route after two raps.  You can rap both options with a single 60m rope.

# Location
First route on of the Quirky Combat wall. 

# Protection
Doubles to #2, single #3 and #4, triples in thin fingers very useful.
