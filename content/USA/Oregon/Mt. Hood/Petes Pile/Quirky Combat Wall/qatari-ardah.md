# Description

Sustained thin finger crack sequence followed by a full pitch of glorious hand jams.

p1: 5.11a, 29m, pass two roofs using a thin finger crack. The many foot chips make the whole thing possible, but there is no denying that the two roofs are going to test your creativity. After 20m, a loose pillar appear on the left: resist the temptation to stem on it! If you need to exit the crack, look for crimpers on the right face instead.

p2: 5.10b, 22m, glorious hands!

A single 60m will get you down, barely. Tie knots!

# Location

About 20 yards left of Quiet Ninja. The huge first roof is impossible to miss.

# Protection

Doubles from Black Totem to C4 #2, singles of C4 #3 and #4, single Metolius #0, offset nuts. Triples of blue and yellow Totems useful.
