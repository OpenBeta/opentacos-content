# Description
Start with a section of perfect hands, then switch to a thin fingers crack that narrows to a seam and overcome the challenge using a mix of stemming and crack technique.

24m long. A 60m easily gets you down.

# Location
About 30 yards left of Quadratic Judo.

# Protection
Doubles from Black Totem to C4 #2, 1x Metolium #00, offset nuts, brass offsets. Climbable withtout the brassies, but you have to make a long run that would be a clean fall (PG-13). Very PG-13 without offset nuts.
