# Description
A challenging climb that starts to the right of a detached block.  This climb has some fun moves getting over a bulge near the start to a nice stance. Then its a nice crack up to the anchors. Climb protects well. has a .10a direct start up the block face or an easier.6 to the left of the block. Like all the climbs in the area be prepared for moss and dirty conditions which will hopefully improve as people get out and climb here.  the conditions ratchet up the grade a notch IMO

# Location
first climb you come to once you past Schoolroom Cracks - look for the detached block

# Protection
pro to 3", could use a larger cam to protect move over bulge
