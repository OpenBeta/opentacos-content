# Description
This is a pretty committing climb for the grade. There are holds, the moves are there, but it might not be so straight forward. Lots of great small edges, and some good smearing/stemming opportunities for the taller folk. Great lead if you're feeling up to the challenge, or a wonderful TR if someone were to lead Dunce or Schoolroom.

# Location
Two cracks right of Dunce, 5.6

# Protection
Gear to 2", the gear is sparce in places, but you can protect rather safely.
