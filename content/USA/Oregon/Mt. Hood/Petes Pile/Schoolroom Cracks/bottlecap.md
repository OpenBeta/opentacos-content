# Description
The crux is a roof/ceiling that is shaped like a bottle cap (hence the name). Climb right of the ceiling to the face and then 40 feet to the top-chains. First 30 feet are tough to protect, but scaling the roof is well worth the climb.

# Location
The closest climb to the Playground.

# Protection
Standard rack - Lots of opportunity for nuts.
