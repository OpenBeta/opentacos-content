# Description
this very dirty climb follows a flared crack up the right side of schoolroom cracks. there is a directional bolt to allow top roping this route from the shared Smokin' anchors, which makes this a marginally fun climb. Leading this would seem dubious with all that moss...

# Location
to the right of Smokin'. follows angled crack up to Smokin' anchors

# Protection
book says pro to 2" but I would stick to leading smokin' and use this as a TR only
