# Description
Sit start and follow the obvious line of edges to a scary topout! The topout is mossy/ dirty and potentially dangerous if you don't at least scope it out. I would recommend rapping down and cleaning it. There's also a Indirect variation that's slightly harder. The footledge is on. Without the footledge it's a grade harder. Don't pull too hard on the hollow death block on top of the boulder! It is a mandatory hold for the topout unless someone used a prybar to get it off.
