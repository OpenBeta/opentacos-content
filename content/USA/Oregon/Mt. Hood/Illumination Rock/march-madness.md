# Description
This is the obvious ice pillar on the south face of Illumination Rock. It is about 200 feet high and typically comes in during late winter and early spring, though it has come in fat as early as January. Once on top you have the option of climbing the steep snow field to the true summit and rapping the east ridge to the saddle, or rapping the route.

# Location
the south face of illumination rock below the big hanging snow field right of the south chamber

# Protection
ice screws
