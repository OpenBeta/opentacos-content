# Description
A fun mixed line on the south face of Illumination Rock, it climbs rime covered rock before entering an ice tunnel and then climbing an awesome crux dihedral (half rock and half rime when we did it). As of yet it has not been climbed to the summit, but ends at the West Gable as most of the routes on that aspect of the rock do. See the Mt. Hood Climber's Guide for more information.

# Location
The buttress immediately left of the South Chamber.

# Protection
pickets, ice screws, nuts and cams... depending on conditions it could take a whole bunch of stuff, but don't expect to have anchors at the belay stances or anything besides mental pro if its really rimed up.
