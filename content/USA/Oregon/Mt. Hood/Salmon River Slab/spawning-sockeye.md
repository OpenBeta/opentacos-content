# Description
Another new route at Salmon Slab. This is the left route of the 2 new ones. It starts in the middle of the slab and heads straight up passing 3 bolts to the anchors. Make your way up the easy slab on big holds. Climb gently and wear a helmet because the rock isn’t the best quality and it’s a new route.

# Location
Walk about 100 feet to the right of the main slab. This route is the left of the 2 new routes. Right up the middle of the slab

# Protection
3 stainless steel bolts to the anchor. Lower off biners.
