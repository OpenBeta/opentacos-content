# Description
New little baby route at salmon slab. This is located about 100ff to the right of the main slab. 4 tightly spaced bolts to mussy hooks. The route has been cleaned a ton, but like the rest of salmon slab, stuff will keep falling off so wear a helmet. This route is wet a lot and one of the last to dry hence the name.

The route is a slab with good crimps going up. There’s a small crux right at 3/4 bolt.

# Location
100ft right of the main slab. There’s 2 new routes and this is the right one.

# Protection
4 stainless steel bolts to mussys.
