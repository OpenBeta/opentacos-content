# Description
Scott Peterson (Plaidman) did this route ground up. Sometimes Plaidman was solo, sometimes getting Rhonda or Rick to belay. Rick and Scott came back and freed it afterwards with Ricky snagging the leads on the cruxes and cruising them. Route is well bolted as the bolts are sturdy 1/2 x 5-1/2 Stainless steel and not runout.  but pro is recommended for the first 60 feet which is a cruiser 5.7. A single 60 meter is all you need to rappel off.

The rock is solid, sort of an andesitic cross between Smith Rock Welded Tuft and Maple Canyon cobbles.  Rumor I'd heard is that it's the best route on the rock! (only 2 *cough* routes on it at this time)

# Location
Directions are on the main page same as the Becky route. Access the route as if you would be doing the Becky route, except head towards the left (East) side instead of the right/behind. The top of the route is clearly visible from your car Down on the road- so just drive up the road till you see it and walk up to it.

# Protection
22 Draws and or long slings, 60m rope
