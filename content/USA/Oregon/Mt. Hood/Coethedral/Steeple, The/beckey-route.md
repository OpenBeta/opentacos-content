# Description
The Beckey is the easy and fun short south side route to the summit. Class 4 @80 meters up a narrow dirt gully behind (South of) the rock to the notch of the Steeple, tie off a big boulder or 2 for a belay at the high point of the notch.

The route romps straight up the big, more solid than they look, awesome knobs and lumps directly above to the summit approx 80' above.

Descent: A 2 rope rap to the Northwest or do the new single 60 meter rap off the massive hardware on Brother Mike towards the Northeast.

# Location
You can go any way, straight uphill. However, from your car in the little turnaround next to the closed off spur road, the best way is to hike approx 225 paces up the overgrown near closed road that heads west, turning left into the woods over a small culvert on a small log and head straight up, paralleling just left of a drainage in the semi-open areas until you see some small cliffs which had not been previously visible just on your right. Pass through the Devils Club (some clippers will easily clear a trail through this small patch) and skirt the cliffs on the left approx 200' more tending up and left until you get to the base of the NW side of the Steeple. This is for North and west side routes, including the Beckey Route.

# Protection
Only need some long slings for ties offs. An ice axe would greatly reduce the sporting approach. Adventure climbing!
