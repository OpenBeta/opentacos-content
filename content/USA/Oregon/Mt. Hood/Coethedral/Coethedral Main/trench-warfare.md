# Description
This climb would be a three-star 5.9 if it were well cleaned. As of July 2018 the moves are very enjoyable, however, it feels like every hold is about to come out of the wall. This is likely because of the dirt and moss caking the surrounding rock, although the rock itself seems more brittle than elsewhere on the formation. I tried to clean off much of the dirt and moss when I rappelled. Likely this route needs regular traffic/cleaning as it is in the drainage of that part of the cliff. I would suggest belaying from one side or the other to avoid debris falling into your face.

P1 - 54 meters and 15 bolts to a shared anchor with Upskirt or 30 meters to first rap anchor.

P2 - 90 feet and 12 bolts to base of Salathe Highway.

# Location
The gully between Lava Flow and Excalibur.

# Protection
Bolts.
