# Description
This is a fantastic route that ascends a rock spine for what seems like forever.  Solid and clean, this is

the

route to do if you are able to climb the grade.  The leader can bail right to the

Trench Warfare

rap anchor at 90' to break up

Excalibur

into two pitches.  This is not recommended though because 1) it's more fun to just keep going & going and 2) the belayer is going to get bombed with anything coming down while belaying at the

Trench Warfare

rap anchor.

# Location
Left side of the Coethedral formation.  At the time of this writing, a wood sign at the base of

Excalibur

identifies it.

Getting down from the top of

Excalibur

is obvious and easy.  Rappel with a 60m rope to the

Trench Warfare

rap anchor (climber's right).  One more rappel gets you to the ground.

# Protection
28 lead bolts and a Fixe carabiner sport anchor.
