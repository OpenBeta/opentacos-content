# Description
Start as for the second pitch of Lava Flow, but instead of heading left to the tree half way up, on the northern most route to the Dragons Spine top, step right up into the maw of the beast and follow the shallow cleft in the Â bisected fold of rock past 6 bolts to the top of the pinnacle.
