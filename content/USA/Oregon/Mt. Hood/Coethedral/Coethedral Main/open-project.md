# Description
Just thought others might want want to take on this interesting line. I can't work on it any more. This is a mostly unprepped project on the far left side of the Coethedral formation.  It looks like Lake Tahoe's

Candyland

in some sections; smooth rock with grapefruit sized rocks jutting out.  It has been cleaned a little but needs work.  The yellow lichen present on this climb may produce asthma like symptoms in people who are generally not prone to asthma.  Consider wearing a dust mask while cleaning.

If following the path shown in the picture, the grade will probably end up being between a 5.11b and 5.11d.

# Location
North (left) side of the formation, just around the corner from the

Bewitched

start. The obvious corner, left-trending line.

# Protection
10+? lead bolts.
