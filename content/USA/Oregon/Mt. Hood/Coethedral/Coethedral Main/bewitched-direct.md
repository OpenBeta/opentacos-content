# Description
A fun bit of climbing on sweet jugs and nubbins, with a scary mantel move over a big undercut in the pillar. Start off climbing over a small bulge with good holds, moving up to a dirty, small ledge. Beware of your footing here. Continue directly upwards on chunks of varying sizes until you get to the roof. The bolt for this move is easily within reach on the right side. Crux it, then finish out the last 20' to the anchors.

Beware of loose nubbins, and especially dirt on the small ledge about 30' up. I nearly lost my footing climbing past this. Needs some aggressive cleaning.

# Location
Farthest left route on the wall. Stays left of original Bewitched bolt line. Rappel from rap rings.

# Protection
11 bolts
