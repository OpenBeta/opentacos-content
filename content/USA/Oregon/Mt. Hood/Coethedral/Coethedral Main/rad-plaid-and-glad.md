# Description
Is it better than sex? i think so but, but I couldn't see the grade difference (both felt like 5.7 IMO).  all the climbs i've done here have great hands and feet..so long as they dont pop off. also i ended up using about every other bolt because, as like all climbs here, there are so many. Not complaining but if you are solid at the grade, this makes for a faster climb

# Location
2nd climb after getting to base of cliff.  to the left of runaway weasel. right of Better than Sex.

# Protection
14 draws
