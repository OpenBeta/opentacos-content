# Description
Pitch 1:  Travels up and slightly left for 55 meter pitch, 21 bolts.

Pitch 2: Nine bolts to a large tree.

Please note you cannot lower off the first pitch because it is a full rope length, and watch out for rock fall.

# Location
This route is located immediately to the right of Trench Warfare gulley.

At top, rappel from Trench Warfare route.  I made the mistake of rappelling down to the right and I do not recommend doing so.

# Protection
Generously bolted.  First pitch has bolted anchors.  Second pitch you will use a large tree for an anchor.
