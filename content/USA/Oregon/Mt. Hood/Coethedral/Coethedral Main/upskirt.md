# Description
17 draws and some full length slings in a single 52 meter pitch. Climb Bewitched to where it jogs right into the chimney, except instead of zigging out onto the face to the P1 Bewitched belay anchors, stay in the chimney, reaching far left to clip the Bewitched bolts on the face as you ascend. The exit at the top of the chimney is one of 2 holes on either side of a large unattached chockstone. This block use to be the belay stance for Trench Warfare (until it tipped off). Slimy up through the hole you fit or like best. Belaying off of the upper Trench Warfare anchors is best.
