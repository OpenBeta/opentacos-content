# Description
Immediately to the right of The Dragons Spine is a deep gully. P1 Follow the gully past 15 bolts for @40+ meters to where it heads right onto a small stance on a buttress and the belay. P2, start up the easy gully tending left and clip 20 more bolts which head up and slightly left to a steeper headwall and the rap anchors in the middle of the face visible from below. Climb till you run out of rock which must be @ 300 feet or so off the deck. Rap with 1 single 60 meter rope in 4 single rope raps straight down then over (climbers right) to the Gratitude buttress and finally past Ujahns Delight - it's obvious.

Kyle named this Gratitude in appreciation for me dragging him and his brother Geoff out there. Not sure Geoff was as appreciative:-)
