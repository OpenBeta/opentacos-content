# Description
Do pitch one of Lava Flow. Instead of heading straight up for the 2nd pitch of Lava Flow, turn left towards a large flake/minor pinnacle @10 feet to the left, turn the corner and drop down into the vegetated gully, then run up the gully and sneak up on the Old Witch. The combined age for the 3 geriatric guys of the first ascent party totaled 176 years with 115 total climbing years between them...and if they could get up it....LOL!

# Location
Continue up The Salethe Highway. Rap as for The Salethe Highway with a single doubled 60M

# Protection
9 bolts, although there are 2 medium cams placements between bolts up higher, or you can skip the placements and just clip bolts.
