# Description
The Dragon's Spine goes for 2 pitches of unbelievably amazing and fun knob climbing.

P1:

Follow the arete straight up near or on the spine. Wander back and forth passing the intermediate rap anchor (do not use this) at the half way point and continue to follow the best knobs to a belay 56 meters up located @ 90 feet under and slightly to the right of the top of the pinnacle which ends at the 2 stainless Fixe Sport anchors on a tiny stance.

P2:

Step up and right just enough so you don't land on your belayer and follow the 15 bolts up and tending slightly left past the sub pinnacles to the top of the main Dragons Spine Pinnacle.

Rappel:

From the top of the pinnacle, rappel straight down as for

Gothic Rocks

, the route just to the left. You can do this in three raps. If the slings at the top look iffy for you, simply step around left to the other side where the

Grey Ghost

Stainless Fixe anchors are located. A 60m is enough for all raps.
