# Description
Begin as for the 12+ streak for 2-3 bolts and then bust right to the impossible looking, steep, clean arete. Just has two directional bolts. Planning to bolt the whole thing for lead with temporary bolts next time it dries out. Stays wet more often than almost anything else here. Grade is a total guess.

Haven't asked if the Holloways did the moves on toprope, but just from rapping down it seems like this thing could be super super hard, if it goes at all. Watch out for poison oak near the base and above if rapping in. Trimmed all of it early season but still watch out.

Give it a go.

# Location
Right side of the black streaked wall at sky burial.

# Protection
Two old expansion bolts. Some rust. Would need to toprope from the anchors to the left and clip the directional.
