# Description
Start from the same pedestal as Axe to fall, but further right, pulling a couple of super fingery, thin pocket moves through an otherwise blank face(pointless+heinous) to a no-hands, and like ten knee bar opportunities. Head up a steep, pocketed bulge just left of the dihedral, fun moves here and a great headwall above with higher rock quality.

needs to be rebolted, got some rust. Upon rebolting will probably extend a few moves higher, and give a new anchor location distinct from Axe to Fall.

# Location
The right of the two routes off the pedestal. low first bolt.

# Protection
Mechanical bolts, some rust, likely need replacement.
