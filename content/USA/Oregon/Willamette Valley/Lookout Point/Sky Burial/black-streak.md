# Description
A positively beautiful route. A technical intro leads to a thin crux and then perfect thin pocket pulls on a black streaked panel and rounded dihedral. Likely some of the best rock quality in the zone. Gets runoff and needs cleaning after a heavy rain.

The bolts are super rusted and strength is hard to evaluate. this one is high on my list of routes to re-bolt with glueins.

# Location
The middle black streak, between two distinctive aretes

# Protection
rusted plated steel bolts, in a water streak for 15 years, in need of replacement.
