# Description
Great vertical tech face to arete movement punctuated by a stemming rest. Has some long reaches and smaller holds but can be domesticated with the right foot sequencing and balance work.

Everyone has started going right at 2/3 height to get the stem. Several people asked me to move the bolt. There is now a gluein further right than the original, with the metal spray painted black, that is the preferred bolt to clip from the stemming stance.

You can still use the other one if you want to climb some kind of harder face eliminate or your arms are just mega long.

Not a great warmup unless you flail: an on-your-feet techpiece for sure.

# Location
on the vertical wall just left of the steep arete of FTMB.

# Protection
6 glueins to 2 bolt anchor
