# Description
General description not given

# Location
Pink in topo. EOES, across Guilded, Finishing on Hit the Tree

# Protection
Passes 10 gluein bolts along the way.

Note that the tree was padded (with moving blankets strapped over foam sleeping pads) for the first ascent, mainly to breathe easier skipping 1-2 clips at the end. If you have something left in the tank to clip the last bolt, you won't need to worry about the tree at all.

Yes, it does in fact blow if you hit the tree...
