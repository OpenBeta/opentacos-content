# Description
Long pulls on small holds from the get go, leading to the technical/dynamic crux at the 3rd bolt, to the pretend-a-rest, to a nice outro on an idyllic green pocketed panel.

Great rock quality, especially for the area. Has a few monos but their use is optional and overall the route isn't fingery for the grade, especially compared to it's neighbors. Many different betas at the crux, depending on whether you want to leverage finger strength, dynamic power, tension trickery, or reach. Escapes up and left to join the arete after the last clip, where you should clip the left of the two bolts to stay clear of the tree. Then follows the arete back right to the chains.. currently equipped with steel permadraws.

About as fun as a 35 foot sport route can get here. Climbs as ~V6 to V4.

# Location
The rightmost route on the RIP, goes left to the arete after the 4th bolt.

# Protection
5 glueins to 2 bolt anchor.
