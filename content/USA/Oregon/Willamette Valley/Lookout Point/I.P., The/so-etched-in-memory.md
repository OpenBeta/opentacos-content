# Description
The linkup of EOES into the Gilded finish, with fun new ground in between. Climb to the slopers at the lip, don't clip the anchors of EOES (the ledge up and left is off, if you mantle there you've finished EOES, though you can throw a heel to rest, etc). Traverse the band of sloping pockets right, with the better of the marginal rests being in two deep pockets at the end of the traverse. Clip the lone bolt, then head up and right through a nicely twisted sequence, joining the last few moves and the last bolt of Guilded, with one lunge near the lip being a great place to punt.

Adds a 5.12 section of thin pocket pulls through some of the best rock quality and movement on the wall. Weaves a crazy line to follow good natural features, flows allright considering. Depending on your power-endurance and resting ability, it could either be a fun little bonus, or a serious fight... ~35 moves total. Grade needs confirmation.

Please respect that the low linkup (FTMB start) is closed, and the only remaining closed project at the crag.

While you could add another hard move climbing straight up through the last bolt of EOES, it would definitely be an eliminate.

# Location
Center of the RIP. In the beta photo, blue to aqua to green.

# Protection
7 gluein bolts. Clipping all of them may or may not be in your best interest. Stick clip the 1st or 2nd of EOES.
