# Description
Steep and friendly swiss cheese pockets take you off the starting ledge. At the 5th bolt doing a long reach, stemming, or working the arete allow passage through the crux for people of various body types. Either you won't notice the crux or you'll be at a loss for how to proceed. Has a long draw to help with cleaning on the lower.

I'm generally opposed to giving a route this crumbly and short 4 stars, but I also can't imagine 5.10 (in the willamette valley, big qualifier) getting much more fun than this. It's cleaned up pretty well actually.

# Location
Just left of where the trail hits the wall, look for an overhanging swath of honeycombed pockets and a pretty slash of green rock high and right.

# Protection
7 glueins, loweroffs
