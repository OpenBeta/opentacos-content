# Description
Full name "The 40 year old swingers", this is actually two variations.

A short route. Stick clip the first bolt and jump start or boulder your way up to a mossy slab with ample jugs. Two starts are possible, with separate first bolts.

May be good but will require some industrial level moss removal.

Probably WAY harder than 5.9, only one way to find out...

# Location
The lower angle wall to the left of Swampbender.

# Protection
2ish bolts to chains. An alternate starting bolt to the left. Stainless and should be in good condition
