# Description
Steep start leads to a very technical dead vert face and arete. Likely needs cleaning but all-time movement as reported by Forest. Will update once I get around to climbing it.

# Location
Up and left, round the back behind all the benders. The last good looking feature, behind the RIP as well.Â  probably 100m walk past airbender, faces NW

# Protection
SS mech bolts. may be hidden in new moss. probably still in good shape.
