# Description
Start up the streak as for Airbender, passing two cruxy sections, both calling on a bit of pocket strength. Escape left just before the boulder crux of Airbender: climb into the chimney finishing on the back side of the prow for 3 bolts of steep but easy 3-d climbing. One 5.10-ish move heading right feels committing but is reasonably protected.

# Location
Climb airbender and then bail into the chimney.

# Protection
11 glueins
