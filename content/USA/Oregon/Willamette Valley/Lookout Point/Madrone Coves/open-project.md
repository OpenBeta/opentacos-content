# Description
In case youre wondering what this is, Just left of donkey bender is a line of 3 temporary bolts on the steep wall. Needs more cleaning, and the best line is probably 3-6 feet right of those bolts.

Not reccomended in it's current state, but not trying to keep anyone off it either.

# Location
30 feet left of donkey bender, on the short steep wall.

# Protection
3 temporary bolts, plated steel hangers, single biners on each, one bolt anchor for now.
