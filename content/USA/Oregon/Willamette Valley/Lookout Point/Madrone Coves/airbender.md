# Description
This one is a LINE. The high prow at the center of the first "madrone cove".

Water streak/rib feature with sweet pockets and body-English climbing low, exit the chimney to the right for wild moves on mostly good holds out front-side of the high prow, a brief bouldery crux. Continuously steep, airy position with a couple of dissapointingly good rests (would be mega enduro otherwise). Good rock quality starting after the first bolt. Start is fine without a stick clip

Knee pad may be nice, mainly to save wear on your pants/skin. But certainly not cause you need even more rest!

# Location
Look for a water streak/rib feature that emanates from a chimney and adjacent arete 50 ft up. Waterbender climbs in the chimney and onto the left face of the prow. Airbender heads out the steep, right face of the prow

# Protection
11 gluein bolts.
