# Description
This is a lightly overhanging, juggy endeavour similar to Fondue or Fondon't, as pumpy but perhaps with a more straightforward crux. Should be really fun as it continues to clean up and smooth out. Huecos, thread-throughs, telephone jugs, knobs, pockets. As long as you're not completely off-route, the most fragile features have been cleaned and tested. The first and second clips are relatively easy, and then it heads up and slightly left on sustained jugs and pockets.

Has a capping roof and seems to stay completely dry, even during or after heavy downpour.

Take care while clipping the 2nd bolt, or use a stick clip.

# Location
In the last "cove" to the right before Piranha pockets and the R.I.P. 40 feet up from the main trail. Begins up very featured rock on the right side of the cove, clipping the first, oversized glue-in from a stem on a pedestal, up and slightly left from there.

# Protection
5 glue in bolts to sport loweroffs.

First bolt is oversized and highly visible polished stainless. The following bolts are smaller gague and spraypainted matte black.

Take care while clipping the 2nd bolt, or use a stick clip.
