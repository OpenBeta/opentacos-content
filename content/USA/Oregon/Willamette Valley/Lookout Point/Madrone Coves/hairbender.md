# Description
The longest route here. Three fun boulder problems of escalating difficulty separated by sit down rests. Â Can be a little harder while hanging the draws on the final (crux) boulder. May place a small chain here.

Closely bolted with mostly safe falls, but keep an attentive belay and be aware of the ledges. Still recommended.

# Location
Starts in the "cave" feature just left of Fondue and right of Airbender.

# Protection
11 glueins to 2 bolt anchor.
