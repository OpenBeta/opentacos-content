# Description
The clean, ever-shaded, green-streaked panel.

Easy approach climbing to a hard six move boulder with unique grips. High quality rock, movement, and aesthetics. Maybe the best of the 'roped boulders' here.

Can only say with confidence that it's somewhere between V8 and V10. I didn't use the thin mono above the 2nd bolt, going left instead.

The crux felt low percentage and required good (very cold and dry) conditions. I never got close unless I was also numbing out by the end. Has the kind of holds you hit dynamically but precisely, and then have little hope of readjusting on, compounding any errors or hesitation. Maybe for some could be easier than EOES, but for me felt harder, and also less tweaky. Similar angle to the RIP, but with more edgework than pockets, and almost zero endurance required.

Took something like 7 sessions and 20+ goes over 6 months, with 3 or 4 sessions before I even did all the moves. Thanks to everyone for all the belays!

all the stars, with the obvious qualifier that it's a 20 foot sport route, do as you will...

# Location
Up the hill to the left, around the corner from the 'benders and the swingers. A small cave feature low and a green panel above lurking behind a switchback in the trail

# Protection
4 glueins. 1 bolt anchor with a steel lower biner.

Stick clip reccomended.
