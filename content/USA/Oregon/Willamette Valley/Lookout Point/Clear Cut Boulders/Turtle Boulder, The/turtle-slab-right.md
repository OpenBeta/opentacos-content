# Description
Stand start two high pockets. The left pocket is shallow and the right one is a deep two finger pocket. Work up to the bulge, mantle and scramble to the left to top out in order to avoid poison oak.

I am assuming the route has been done before since it is clean with bolts at the top. Let me know if you have any info.

There is definitely a lower start on the face and an even lower start in the cave that someone has been working on.

# Location
South facing slab on the Turtle boulder.

# Protection
2 pads and a spotter
