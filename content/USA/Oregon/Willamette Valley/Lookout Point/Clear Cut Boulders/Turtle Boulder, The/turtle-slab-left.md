# Description
Stand start with a left facing edge and a high two finger pocket. Work up and left using edges and small pockets, Mantle onto the ledge and scramble to the top. Top out left to avoid poison oak. There are bolts at the top but I did not inspect them or use them.

I am assuming people have climbed this since it was already cleaned and there were bolts at the top.

There is potential for a much harder sit start.

# Location
This route is on the south face of the Turtle boulder.

# Protection
2 pads and a spotter
