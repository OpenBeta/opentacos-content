# Description
Main line on the largest boulders face. Follows a tufa like feature and finishes with a large move from pockets to a good hold. Top out is a bit high but on decent holds. Stand start at the obvious jug at about 7 feet. There are definitely a few more lines that feed into this one.

# Location
Main line on front of the largest boulder.

# Protection
Pads and a spotter
