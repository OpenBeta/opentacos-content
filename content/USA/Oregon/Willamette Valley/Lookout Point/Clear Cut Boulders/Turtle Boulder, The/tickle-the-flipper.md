# Description
Start low on the arete under what looks kind of like a flipper of the turtle on decent pockets. Climb out the small roof and up the arete on mostly good holds but tricky feet. Fun!

# Location
Left of and below the start of "Turtley". If looking into the hole and the big prow that might be the turtle's head, the flipper is uphill to the left. Start low on the arete

# Protection
A few pads
