# Description
Mind blowing feature. Climb off a pedestal and through the window on good pockets. Not grovelly or anything, just mantle through the portal and into another world. If you have a different name for this feel free to comment. Thanks everyone for the monumental cleaning effort on this boulder

# Location
The easiest line to the window, on the large turtle shaped boulder

# Protection
would be difficult to pad with the flake/ledge.
