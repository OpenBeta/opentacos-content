# Description
Start standing with left hand on a crimp at head height and right hand on a decent hold at chest height. Step on the green ledge to get to a big pocket on the right then traverseÂ left and up on great holds!

Has anyone else climbed this before? It needed a lot of cleaning so I am assuming I am the first. I am also open to opinions about the grade.

There might be potential for a sit start that is down and to the right but would be very dabby.

# Location
This route is on the east facing wall of the large boulder with a big dead stump on it west of the Turtle boulder. If you are looking up into the window of the Turtle this climb is directly behind you.

# Protection
2-3 pads
