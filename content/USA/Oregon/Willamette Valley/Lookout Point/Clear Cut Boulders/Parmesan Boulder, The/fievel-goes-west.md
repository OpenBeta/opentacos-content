# Description
Sit start on the west arete(left), left hand on a great solid crimp, right hand low on the corner, a few powerful moves with fun compression, side pulls and heel hooks to gain the slab, simple top out.

Would be a great problem if the steep section lasted a little longer.

I listed this as a new FA as the route required extensive scrubbing and idk if it’s ever been done before, please let me know if you think it was previously done, I’m more than happy to update name/grade beta.

# Location
Left of Stuart Little, sit start under the west arete on the Parmesan Boulder.
