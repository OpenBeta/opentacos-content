# Description
Start left on a slopey dish and right on a decent three finger pocket, both about chest height. Climb straight up through thin holds to better holds and hope you cleaned more moss off the topout than I did.

# Location
Uphill and slightly left of the large turtley boulder. There is a faint old logging road just uphill of the turtle boulder. Beyond that and just inside the tree-line stands this boulder.

# Protection
two pads
