# Description
Squat start low as possible on the west side of the morel. I used a left hand undercling pocket and a right hand side pull below the arete. A few fun moves. If only it lasted longer!

I assigned a temporary name until I hear back.

I have reached out to the FAist for name/grade beta and will update when available.

# Location
