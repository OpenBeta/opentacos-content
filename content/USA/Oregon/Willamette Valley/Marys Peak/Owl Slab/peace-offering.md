# Description
Peace Offering climbs to the highest aspect of Owl Slab,  just right of the center of the formation,  past five bolts. The first bolt is somewhat left of the rest of the bolt line due to rock quality. Climb the slab on good edges and fiction to pull the overlap/bulge past the fifth bolt to the anchor.
