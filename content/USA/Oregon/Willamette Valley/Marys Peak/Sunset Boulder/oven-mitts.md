# Description
Start on the two obvious holds just in front of the tree. Move right to the rail then finish with big moves to sloping top of boulder.

# Location
Use the same parking and entry path as the pillars (44.508587, -123.572010). Rather than going down to the right to the pillars, keep going straight when you enter the path until you see a boulder on the left.

# Protection
2 pads preferable. Could use 1 pad and spotter.
