# Description
Often mossy, but a fun adventure climb and worth the trip from Corvallis if only for the element of adventure.

# Location
Walk downhill on a faint trail from the elevation 3500 parking area. You'll see the anchors glimmering atop a boulder. Pull a quick unexposed V0 move to reach the anchors and rap down. You can technically walk around and access the base of the route as well.

# Protection
3 bolts, plus anchors at the top. It may feel slightly runout, but bolts are in good places and could be supplemented by placing trad protection for your own comfort. Or, just top rope the route.
