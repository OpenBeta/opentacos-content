# Description
No such thing as a jug ladder outside huh? Fun, simple problem on the left of a nice V2 line. Sit start it, dyno the first move if you are feeling spicy.

# Location
This is a V0- variation of what seems to be a pretty popular line to the left, though I'm not sure what the name of that problem is, but it seems like a V2. This is a good problem for a warm up.
