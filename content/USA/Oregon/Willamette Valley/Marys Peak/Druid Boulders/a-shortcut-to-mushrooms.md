# Description
Sweet little Smith-y boulder with nice flakes & pockets (when they aren't under moss). Top out in the crack. There is a V2 variation (Second Breakfast) if you sit-start the problem.

# Location
After following the game trail into the woods from the pull out for about 50 yards, head down the middle of the hill for another 50 or so yards & you'll come upon the backside of the boulder. There is nice flat ground for pads & it's next door to some other problems already pictured in this area.
