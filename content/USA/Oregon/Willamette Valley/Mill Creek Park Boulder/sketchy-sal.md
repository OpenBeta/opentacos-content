# Description
Same start at Shallow Hal in the cave, but this one heads straight up rather than to the left. Use underclings to work your way over the top of the cave. The moves take you to the left a little bit, but for the most part it goes straight up.

# Location
Start by climbing up to the cave.

# Protection
none
