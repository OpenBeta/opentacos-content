# Description
Starting in a shallow cave, the climb ascends through three distinct sections: a juggy roof, a textured slab with positive holds, and an overhanging arete. This is another route that is often wet, although it can be climbed even if the slab is wet. The slab is textured enough and has enough positive holds that the dampness isn't an issue. While the juggy roof to start is highly enjoyable, the overhanging arete to finish is perhaps even more enjoyable as well as being the crux. A classic at the crag!

# Location
The only route in Midgard. Up and left from the Dream Wall, just around the corner.

# Protection
4 bolts and 4 permadraws to sport loweroffs.
