# Description
Very intriguing arete/dihedral feature with many good holds throughout, but steep enough that you'll be pulling fairly hard. Can be climbed a number of ways. This route is often wet, but can still be climbed. The lower section stays wet the longest, but is straightforward and can easily be climbed when wet. If the arete is dry, then you're good to go.

# Location
The only route on Wall Whitman, just up and left from the Old Growth Wall. Starts up on a ledge that can be reached via 4th class scramble. There is currently a fixed line here to make reaching the belay easier.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
