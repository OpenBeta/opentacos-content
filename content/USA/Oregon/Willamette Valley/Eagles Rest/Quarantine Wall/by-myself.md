# Description
Multiple cruxes punctuated by good rests on fantastic features. Lower off the first set of anchors at 75 ft or fully recover on the low angle ledge and continue up the quality black rock to the higher anchors. Same grade either way, but the extension will keep you on your toes. Tie a knot if using a 60m when lowering from the upper anchors. I highly recommend climbing to the upper anchors.

# Location
Between Glad To See You Go and Fourteen Days. Third open line from the right on the Quarantine Wall.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs. Lower (75 ft) and upper (100 ft) anchors.
