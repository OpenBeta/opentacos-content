# Description
Starting left of a large crack, climb through 4 bolts with interesting features and transition across shallow dihedral to better rock. Continue up through moderate and thoughtful climbing for a few more bolts and prepare for the distinct technical crux at the top. May be a challenging onsight if near your limit. Second and third pitches are closed projects, please do not use the fixed line on the second pitch.

# Location
Farthest right open line at the Quarantine Wall. Starts just left of crack feature and climbs up and right into shallow dihedral.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
