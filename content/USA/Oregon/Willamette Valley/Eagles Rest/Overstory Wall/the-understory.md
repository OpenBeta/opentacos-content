# Description
A short and sweet route up the far right side of the Overstory Wall. Good variety of moves for the grade. Some loose rock still, but should continue to clean up as it sees more ascents.

# Location
The farthest right line of the entire crag. Shares the first bolt with the Overstory, then heads straight up.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
