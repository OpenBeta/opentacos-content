# Description
An excellent warmup for the other lines at Eagles. Steep enough to get the blood flowing and thought provoking to get the mind working. A great and fairly sustained route for the grade.

# Location
Starts right by the obvious tree and shares the first bolt with Tree Hugger. Goes straight up the vertical face while Tree Hugger goes left up the arete/dihedral feature. The anchors are a bit left of the rest of the bolt line, although you could potentially climb up to the anchors for the Overstory if you were so inclined.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
