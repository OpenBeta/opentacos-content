# Description
Follows the low-angle arete/dihedral feature by the tree up to a ledge before finishing up a short headwall. Shares the start with Webs of Connection and the finish to the Descent, but it seems to link the worst parts of both routes. While it's not the most exciting route on its own, it does provide TR access for the Descent.

# Location
Shares the first bolt with Webs of Connection before heading left and up the arete/dihedral feature to easier ground. Finishes at the same anchors as the Descent.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
