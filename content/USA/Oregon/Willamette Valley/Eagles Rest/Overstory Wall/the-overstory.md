# Description
A fun route and a good warmup. Starts with a vertical section before finishing with an easy romp up low-angle terrain.

# Location
Shares the first bolt with the Understory (although I highly recommend skipping this bolt, it will significantly reduce rope drag) before heading left and up an arete feature. It's best climbed on the steep face left of the arete, but some will choose to stay more above the arete.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
