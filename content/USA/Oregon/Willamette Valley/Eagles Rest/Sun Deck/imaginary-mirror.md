# Description
Start on good holds that generally get smaller and worse until the roof/bulge. At the roof, the climbing changes from small edges to large slopers with a challenging move to reach high enough past the roof to get onto positive holds. The route stays pumpy with some hard-to-locate holds until the last bolt where it's possible to pause to figure out how to make it through the short runout to the chains.

# Location
First of the overhanging routes toward the right end of the Sun Deck, where the ground narrows and transitions from dirt/gravel to rock. Look for the single permadraw at the left-facing corner capped by a small roof.

# Protection
8 bolts. Steel carabiners on the anchor.
