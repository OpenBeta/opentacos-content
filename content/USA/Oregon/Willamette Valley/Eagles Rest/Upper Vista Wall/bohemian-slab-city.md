# Description
This aesthetic line follows the light streak of rock up the otherwise dark face. Bohemian Slab City offers a change of pace from the predominately vertical to overhanging lines at Eagles. While there are few (if any) pure friction moves, the small feet will definitely give you a calf workout typical of slab routes. There is still some loose rock on the route, but it will continue to clean up as it gets climbed more. The onsight crux comes at the obvious bulge, but this section isn't too difficult once you know where the holds are. The bolt line deviates slightly right at the beginning and then left after the bulge before finishing back in the center, so a few alpine draws might be nice to reduce rope drag. I've also found that back-cleaning one or two of the draws helps with this. A 60m is comfortably long enough for this route.

# Location
The obvious (and currently only) line up the light streak of rock. This route offers great position and excellent views from the anchors.

# Protection
12 bolts to sport loweroffs.
