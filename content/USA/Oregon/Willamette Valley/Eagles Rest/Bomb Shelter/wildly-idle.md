# Description
Should get done more. A bouldery route that has different character than most on the bomb shelter.

Start up three bolts of low angle to a stance below the bulge. A cool dynamic crux move is definitely height dependent: foot options are bleak higher up.

After that a couple of different sequence options clear the bulge, and the lack of a good rest makes the tricky final redpoint crux a bit puntable.

Requires cleaning at the start of the dry season.

# Location
Slab, roof, slab, roof feature at the right side of the bomb shelter. Route to the left is a closed Dee/Dave project.

# Protection
Bolts to sport lower
