# Description
While the Bomb Shelter houses some of the finest and toughest lines at Eagles, Group Therapy is a low-angle route mainly used as an access route to get to the Sun Deck or Animal House. There is usually a fixed line hanging on it. When dry, it can make for a fun little 5.6 if one was so inclined as to lead it. When wet, it can feel like a chore even when ascending via the fixed line.

# Location
Up and around the corner to the left of the rest of the Bomb Shelter, following the low-angle terrain to the Sun Deck.

# Protection
Bolts and fixed line.
