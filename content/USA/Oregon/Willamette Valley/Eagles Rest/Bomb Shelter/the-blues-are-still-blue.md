# Description
Positive holds make for a moderate Â overhanging climb with a really great rest shelf in the middle. Reading the crux (second half) sequence correctly is essential. You'll probably still feel punped out as you turn on to the slab at the top. A great route for leaders trying to break in to the 11s.

# Location
Furtherest right route on Bomb Shelter.

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners on anchor. Lower off.
