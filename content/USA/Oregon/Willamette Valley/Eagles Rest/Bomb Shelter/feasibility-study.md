# Description
Climb Unpaid Internship and find a decent rest at the first anchor, or the better rest at the bolt below it. Â Then start up the more challenging climbing above. The bolts above require some poise and additional energy to clip. The difficulty eases slightly one move after the last bolt, but the remaining moves to the chains are increasingly reachy and are all easy to fall on as the pump builds.

# Location
Closest route to the big tree in the middle of the wall. Identifiable by the intermediate anchor.

# Protection
Two additional bolts above Unpaid Internship. Steel carabiners at upper anchor.
