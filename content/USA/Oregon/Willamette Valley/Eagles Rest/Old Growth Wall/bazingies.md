# Description
This route is longer than it looks and contains a large variety of moves. The name comes from mythical creatures (created by Dee) that live up in old-growth trees. The top anchors of "The Overstory" are to your right at the top and can be easily reached from these anchors.

# Location
Right most route on Old growth wall

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners on anchor. Lower off.
