# Description
Hard to read with crux between the 1st and 2nd bolts. Distinctive crux makes for a tricky onsight, but feels fair for the grade once the beta is figured out. Following the low crux, the climb continues up with fun and sustained 5.10- climbing to the anchors. Parts of the route can stay wet for some time after substantial rain. The second pitch is currently a closed project.

# Location
Between Yap Dog Ego and Billy Lean is Not My Lover on the Dream Wall. Pretty much right in the middle of the Dream Wall, following the dark and often wet streak of rock.

# Protection
Bolts to rap rings.
