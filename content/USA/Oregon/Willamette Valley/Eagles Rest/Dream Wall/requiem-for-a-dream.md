# Description
A fun, long adventure up the Dream Wall. An adventurous lower section leads to a steeper encounter at the top. Longer runners and/or skipping clips helpful to reduce rope drag. Take advantage of rests to leave enough in the tank for the top.

# Location
Between Livin' a Dream and Yap Dog Ego, climbs into shallow right-facing dihedral before continuing straight up.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
