# Description
A short and awkward line, but serves as a warmup for its harder neighbors. Ends on a large ledge with the anchor set back quite a bit, so use an extended anchor if setting up a TR. The ledge makes lowering less than ideal for your rope, so consider rapping off to save rope wear.

# Location
Between Wet Dreams and Launch Escape System, ending at the large ledge.

# Protection
Bolts
