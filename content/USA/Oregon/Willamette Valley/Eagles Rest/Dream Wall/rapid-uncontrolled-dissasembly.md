# Description
This is a tall line of sloper jugs, most of which face the wrong way. The highly featured rock below the roof is the worst of the three on this wall. It may be worth it for the upper headwall, with impressive (and solid) water sculpted features. Significantly harder if you're hanging draws.

"Rapid Uncontrolled Dissasembly" is a polite term for an explosion.

The bail anchor above the roof was added to assist in getting from any of these routes with a rope shorter than 70m. If you stop here you're just doing the worst part of the route, "premature dissasembly", but knock yourself out.

# Location
The middle of the three tall dream wall lines. breaks the midway roof at it's left side.

Start up the right of the two 5.9s, with diagonal ripples (Billy Lean?) and branch right into a very featured light overhang.

# Protection
16ish bolts. will update loweroffs
