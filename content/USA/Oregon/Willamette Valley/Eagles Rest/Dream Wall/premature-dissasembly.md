# Description
There is an anchor just above the midway roof on Rapid Uncontrolled Disassembly, placed to help people get off the longer routes with shorter ropes. If you climb to here you've made it through the worst rock, but all the more worthwhile climbing is above.

# Location
Middle of the three tall dream wall routes.

# Protection
bolts. Not going to put a loweroff here.
