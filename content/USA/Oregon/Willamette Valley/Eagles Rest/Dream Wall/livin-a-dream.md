# Description
Powerful crux on small holds, and plenty of chances to fall up top. Fantastic rock quality. Requires good footwork and crimp strength. This is an Eagles classic and a benchmark for the grade. Best climbed straight up the face. Easy to access top anchors for hanging draws or TR by climbing Somewhere in Middle America or Requiem for a Dream.

# Location
Between Somewhere in Middle America and Requiem for a Dream, third line from the left on the Dream Wall.

# Protection
Bolts to sport loweroffs.
