# Description
Tricky and pumpy with mostly positive holds. The route wanders a bit, so it can be tough to read onsight. This was the first route redpointed at the crag. The second pitch is currently a closed project.

# Location
Between Requiem for a Dream and Wet Dreams.

# Protection
Bolts to rap rings.
