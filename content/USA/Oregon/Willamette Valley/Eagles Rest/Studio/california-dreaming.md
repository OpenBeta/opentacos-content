# Description
Link-up of Tired of All The Possibilities of It All to Rogue Pack. Start on Tired... clipping three bolts then traversing left clipping the link-up bolt before joining with Rogue Pack at the ledge-y handhold. This combines the cruxes of Tired... and Rogue... resulting in a harder variation than either route by itself. Using a long draw for the first bolt after the traverse helps with rope drag.

# Location
Same start as Tired of All of The Possibilities of It All.

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners on anchor.
