# Description
Gently overhanging with tiring but non-cruxy climbing to a less steep and trickier finish. You'll end up very close to Never Snows in Hueco at the end, sharing a foothold or two, but different handholds. Strong candidate for the best route on The Studio.

# Location
Second route from the left. Near the big tree. Finishes just right of Never Snows in Hueco on anchors 5' higher.

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners at anchor.
