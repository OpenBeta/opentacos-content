# Description
Overhanging climbing with some crumbly rock still remaining. The bottom 5 ft of the route is often wet. The second-to-last bolt (5th from the ground?) is midway through the crux and is strenuous to clip, but the fall is clean even if you fall clipping.The difficulty eases around the last (6th?) bolt, but can feel quite pumpy after pulling the crux.

# Location
Farthest left route on the wall. By the big tree that marks the left end of the wall.

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners at anchors.
