# Description
Make use of marginal handholds and some good footwork to survive the physical climbing and clipping down low. Tricky lower angle climbing up higher requires some attention to stay out of trouble until the chains.

# Location
Easily recognizable by the permadraws on the second and third bolts. Ironically, given the name, this route follows the bolt line straight up and is not one of the multiple variations that connect to it.

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners on anchor.
