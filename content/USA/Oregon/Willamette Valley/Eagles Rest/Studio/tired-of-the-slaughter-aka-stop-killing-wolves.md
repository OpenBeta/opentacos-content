# Description
Link-up of Rogue Pack to Tired of All The Possibilities of It All. Start on Rogue Pack climbing to the ledge-y handhold after the 3rd bolt and then traverse right clipping the link-up bolt before joining with Tired of All The Possibilities of It All. This skips the cruxes of Rogue and Tired resulting in a slightly easier variation than either route by itself. Using a long draw for the first bolt after the traverse helps with rope drag but makes for an awkwardly low clip.

# Location
Same start as Rogue Pack.

# Protection
Bolts. Steel carabiners on anchor.
