# Description
Could be classic but the gear is wierd.

I sent it on gear supplemented with the bolts, but I think it would be a better route if fully bolted.

In the middle of the wall, there are two different starting bolts for this route. I took the right start, with a nice pocket and mostly good holds. Then a runout with groundfall potential to get to the second bolt. You could place a finger size cam here but it would be behind a flake. I stick clipped the 2nd bolt. A hard crux to pull up and left above the 2nd, and then place tips size gear before pulling the roof with big moves on big holds. Place another finger sized cam in a pod above the roof, or in a larger pocket place a 4 or 5 camalot. The rest of the upper panel is closely bolted and has good moves on good rock, and gets lower angle and a bit balancy.

# Location
Middle route. Has two different starting bolts.

# Protection
.3 to .75 camalot, and maybe a #4 or 5. 5 ish bolts.
