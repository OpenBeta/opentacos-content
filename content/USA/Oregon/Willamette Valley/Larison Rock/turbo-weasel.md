# Description
A sustained route with decent flow and some body trickery. Lots of holds that face the wrong way, micro-footholds, tension and cryptic movement, but overall very friendly grips for the grade. Steep enough to stay dry in the rain until the final easy topout.

Rifle-esque. If your body-english is on point it could be a quick tick. It certainly is a change-up from the typical Willamette valley climbing though.

# Location
Kindof like

the

line here (not exactly a stacked crag.)

The furthest right route currently, up the steepest and tallest part.

# Protection
very closely bolted. 9 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with quicklinks.
