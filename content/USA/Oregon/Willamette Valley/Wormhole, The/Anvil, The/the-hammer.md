# Description
This felt like a worthwhile line, with great features and imposing, steep climbing. It is also likely the weakest line on the whole anvil formation. It doesn't bode well for future development or popularity here if this is the warmup, but that's currently what it looks like.

Begin up balancy 5.10 climbing for 3 bolts. Then bust a nice rifle-style boulder problem out through the steeps until you gain a beautiful swath of iron hard pocket jugs. Trend up on fun, long, exposed moves, escaping slightly right to the anchor. Established in a very short session.

Open project continues up the headwall. likely a full-reset rest no matter where you cut left, but the intention is to clip the last bolt and move up and left from there on thin pockets.

# Location
on the SW face of the anvil formation. Full shade.

# Protection
5 or 6 stainless stud bolts to two bolt anchor.

Should be replaced with glueins at some point
