# Description
Crux comes right off the ground, leading into the gully. From theere very easy 4th class to the top. Stay heads up as there is lots of loose rock. Many harder variations are possible.

# Location
South side of wolf rock.

# Protection
If you want a rope and a few slings and chocks would be safer.
