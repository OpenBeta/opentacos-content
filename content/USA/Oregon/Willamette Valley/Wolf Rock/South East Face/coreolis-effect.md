# Description
Great route. First and second pitch are bolted. Slightly run-out bolts (and sometimes hard to see) on second pitch but otherwise straightforward. Third pitch on is mixed bolt and pro.

If rapping from first pitch, a double rope rappel is recommended, as it is ~130ft. You could do a double rope rappel with two ropes from the 2nd pitch anchors.

# Location
left most route on Wolf rock (when looking from the road).

# Protection
Small cams, stoppers.
