# Description
This route is basically just a free solo. Don't count on any of the few peices of gear, or anchors to hold a fall. There is one bolted anchor above the chimney. The rest are usually slung blocks/hip belays.

P1&2 - 5.7 X - Follow weaknesses up to chimney. There is a 2 bolt belay above the chimney.

P3&4 - 5.6/5.7 X - Head left following obvious weaknesses. Bad pro and bad rock!

P5&6 - 5.5/4th X - Now your prolly on the chossy and mossy ridge head up following weaknesses to the top.

# Location
Begin to the right of the arch, and follow the obviou bombay chimney weakness.

# Protection
Small rack to "3 Wires are nice.
