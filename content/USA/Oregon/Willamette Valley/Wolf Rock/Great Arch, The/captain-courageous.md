# Description
5th line from the right under the Arch.

Reasonably sustained; IIRC, a middle & upper crux are separated by rests.

The route passes a seepage point in the wall and during/after wet season. Avoid using the places where stuff sprouts for feet/hands in this case :)

# Location
5th route from the right of the Arch corner.

# Protection
9 bolts
