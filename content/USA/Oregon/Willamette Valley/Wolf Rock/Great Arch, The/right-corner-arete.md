# Description
Bolted line on arete at far north end of the great arch.

Admin Note: in 2013, Tyler Adams added a 5.9 sport extension to the route.

Per Tyler's blog post about the route: "Pitch 2: Stay more or less on the arete passing nine more bolts up the the same belay ledge as 'The Peterson Route'. Make two rappels with one rope, or one rappel straight to the ground with two ropes."

quote from "

;

The 2nd pitch bolt line starts right above the first anchors, it stays to the left side of the arete for the first 2 bolts, then moves to the right side of the arete.  The bolts are a bit challenging to see, but they are all there.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
15 bolts plus anchors. 140' tall in total. Some would say slightly run out.
