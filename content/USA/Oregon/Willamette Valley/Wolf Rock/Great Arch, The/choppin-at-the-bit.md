# Description
The next line left of Forked Route. Start up, encounter a crux pulling the bulge, then enjoy easier climbing to the original anchor. There were definitely 5.10 moves but I felt the crux was the pump.

1st continuation: Proceed a ways up & right past two more bolts of 10- to a 2nd chain anchor.

2nd continuation: 3 bolts of gritty 5.9 to a final 3-bolt anchor just short of the ceiling. One bolt is 1/4" with infamous dime-thin smc hangar, but the anchor is 3 phat modern bolts.

# Location
4th route from the right of the corner under the arch.

# Protection
8, 11 or 15 bolts to the anchors, or make it a two-pitch.

Descending from either upper anchor in one rap requires double ropes.
