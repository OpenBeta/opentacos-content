# Description
Proceed up for 5 bolts before what I feel is the most difficult element, transitioning onto the easy upper ramp where bolts are somewhat generously spaced.

70M rope is required to lower (you'll have about 15 feet left). This route shares its anchor with Phadra (.10c/d) and Solstice Party (.10d/11a).

Contrary to the venerable Arch topo, there doesn't appear to be a 2nd lower anchor anymore...

# Location
6th from the right of the arch corner.

Look up for an obvious, shiny "first" bolt that's frighteningly too high, then look down and find the actual first bolt hiding in the shade.

# Protection
8 bolts to anchor with chains; suggest a sling for the 5th to reduce rope drag a bit.
