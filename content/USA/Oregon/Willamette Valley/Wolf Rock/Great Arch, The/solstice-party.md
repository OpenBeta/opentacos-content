# Description
This fantastic route starts under a darker grey bulge/ledge. There is a tricky move or two near the first bolts, and there is a bit of moss here. The rock cleans up after that and it is well worth doing! Fantastic, sustained moves on grippy rock. Make use of the rest where you find them. Numerous side pulls and in-cut edges lead to a tricky move around the 8th bolt -- just when you've been on sustained climbing for the longest. From there it eases up till the anchors.

There is some significant rub on the edge below the anchors so a rappel is perhaps better for your rope than lowering.

(name used from Tyler Adam's drawn topo)

# Location
On a dark patch of grey, with moss, just between two ribs of rock sticking proud of the wall. The rib to the right arches into this route, the 2nd bolt is on it, and you get a nice rest on top of it. The route trends slightly right from there and onto lighter colored rock.

# Protection
10 bolts plus long chain anchors (no cold shuts)
