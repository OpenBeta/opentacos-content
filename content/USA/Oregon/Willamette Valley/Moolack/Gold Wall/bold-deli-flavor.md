# Description
This line doesn't look like much from the ground, but is well worth a lap.  Easy climbing off the talus brings you to the crux all too quickly.  Power through the blank face on thin edges and locks and get established in the shallow flare above.  (it's worth rapping this with a small brush/nut tool to check that it's clean)  Funk up the flare to a perfect ledge below a beautiful zebra-striped corner.  You could easily link through, but to my knowledge, no one has as of yet.  After physical liebacking up the corner, figure out a funky crux and climb up and left into a rewarding hand crack/left facing corner above.

# Location
The middle of the wall.  Look for a black face split by a seam.

# Protection
Gear to 3" Bring micro gear.
