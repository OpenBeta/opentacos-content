# Description
This is the laser-cut corner immediately left of Bold Deli Flavor.  The corner is capped by an 8' roof that creates one of the two cruxes of the route.  The climbing in the corner is pretty heads up.  (Similar in character to the thin climbing on X)  Despite this, the small gear is good (the rock is perfect) and you get the occasional bomber, larger-sized piece.  Belay directly above the roof on a small foot shelf.

Above the belay, fun, moderate moves on beautiful sculpted stone spit you out at a stance below a steep splitter.  This is the second crux and an attentive belayer is recommended to keep you off the ledge.  Gear is good, but is difficult to place.  After the angle relents higher, pass a large tree and finish via the last 40' of BDF.

# Location
Immediately left of Bold Deli Flavor.

# Protection
Gear to 3" Heavy on the micro gear.
