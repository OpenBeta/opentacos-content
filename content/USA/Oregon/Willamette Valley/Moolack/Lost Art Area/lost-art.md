# Description
One of the most classic lines at the crag and one of the better hand cracks in the state.  It's steeper and longer than it looks from the ground.  A 60m will barely reach the ledge just above the ground.  (but it's workable)  A 70 is a better option.

# Location
See topo.

# Protection
Gear to 3.5"
