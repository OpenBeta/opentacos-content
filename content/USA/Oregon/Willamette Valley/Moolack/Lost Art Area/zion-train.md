# Description
Classic climbing with a less-than-classic approach.  When I did it, we climbed up through the bushes and munge to get to the base of the crack.  I can't say I recommend this option and encourage others to rap in from the top to the base of the clean rock.

From this point Zion Train provides steep, engaging movement on perfect cracks and beautiful rock.

# Location
See topo.
