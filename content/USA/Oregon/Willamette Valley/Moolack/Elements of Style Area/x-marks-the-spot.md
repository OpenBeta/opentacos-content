# Description
Exquisite! Delicate and thought-provoking, this line is a true gem. X has perfect rock from bottom to top, is wonderfully varied, and 'just' protects. Begin in a beautiful, black left facing corner and follow the crack to the top. Above the slab at mid-height, the line leaves the corner and climbs the arete on the right for ~20'. (the corner itself hasn't been freed, but will likely go at 12/12+) After the difficulties ease, it's possible to belay at a good ledge above the roof. X can also can be done in one pitch with the foresight to runner your gear correctly.
