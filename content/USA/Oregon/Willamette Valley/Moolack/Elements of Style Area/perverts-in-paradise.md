# Description
The last 60' is one of the best 5.10 corners in the state.  Start by munging through some easy foliage aiming for a left-leaning splitter with a pod.  Pull an off-balance sequence to get past the pod and savor the hero climbing above.  If you're not linking the route into one pitch, look for a belay here.  (before you pull up and left around a small bulge)  Otherwise, runner your gear well and keep climbing up into the gorgeous and sustained left facing wide-hands corner.

# Location
This route sits alone equidistant between Case of the Blues and the right edge of the Gold Wall talus field.  It can be tricky to spot from the ground.

# Protection
Gear to 3".
