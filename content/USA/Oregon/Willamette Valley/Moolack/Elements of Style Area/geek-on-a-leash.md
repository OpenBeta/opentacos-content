# Description
One of the test-pieces at the crag and (to my knowledge) yet to see a second ascent.  Bouldery and mega classic.  The first pitch is fun and pumpy following a beautiful dihedral (the top can get choked with pine needles, so it's worth rapping over with a nut tool) up to the treed ledge.  Above that is a short and fierce crux to a good stance and optional belay.  From here it's 5.10 to the top.

# Location
See topo.

# Protection
Gear to 2"
