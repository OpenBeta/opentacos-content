# Description
One of the best pitches at the grade at Moolack.  Powerful off the ground, this one will stay on you.  This climb has one of the coolest no-hands stances I've ever found.  Originally climbed in two pitches, Elements is easily linked to the trees.

# Location
See topo.

# Protection
Gear to 1.5"
