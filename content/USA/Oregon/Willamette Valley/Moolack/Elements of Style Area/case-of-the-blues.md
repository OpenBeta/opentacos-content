# Description
If this thing got climbed frequently enough to stay clean, it would be easily be a four-star route. It's worth brushing the dust off the top prior to climbing. Start just left of Elements of Style and follow the main crack system up and right to ledgy terrain at mid-height. Belay here (or, if you're feeling chipper, keep going) and then punch it up the beautiful splitter to the top.

# Location
See topo.

# Protection
Gear to 1.25"  Bring micro gear.
