# Description
Killer!  Despite it's short length, this is hands down one of the best fingercracks in the state.  Steep, powerful locks on perfect rock are followed by an airy, but easier sequence on the slab between crack systems.  Thin gear in incipient features is available.

# Location
See topo.

# Protection
Gear to 1.5"
