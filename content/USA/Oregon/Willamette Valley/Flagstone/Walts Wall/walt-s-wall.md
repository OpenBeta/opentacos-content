# Description
This is a fun route with a wide variety of holds.  Climb High Noon or Morning Desire to a small ledge with two sets of belay bolts (optional belay, the climb can be done in one pitch if desired).  From this ledge, Walt's Wall goes straight up through a section of undercling flakes, then moves up and right on pockets and edges.  It finishes at a two-bolt anchor just over a small bulge.

# Location
Climb High Noon or Morning Desire to reach a ledge halfway up the wall.  Walt's Wall starts from here (see beta photo on the Walt's Wall area page).

Rappel once (one 60m rope just barely reaches the ground), or walk off to the right.

# Protection
Bolts, two-bolt anchor at the top.
