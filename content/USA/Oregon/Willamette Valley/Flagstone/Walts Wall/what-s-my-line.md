# Description
What's My Line climbs more like a Smith route than a typical Flagstone slabfest.  After a slabby section at the bottom, the route turns vertical with small but solid crimps and a few underclings.  You may find yourself weaving left and right across the bolt line a few times.  The crux comes between the last two bolts, reaching for a distant pocket with the feet in a wide stem.

# Location
Two bolt lines to the right of Morning Desire (which can be identified by its homemade angle iron hangers).

# Protection
7 bolts, two-bolt anchor at the top.
