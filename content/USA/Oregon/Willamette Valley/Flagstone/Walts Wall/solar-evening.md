# Description
Climb slabby 5.8-ish terrain and continue straight up when a line of bolts (Afternoon Delight, 5.8) forks off to the right.  When the rock steepens near the top, the crux comes on solid edges to the right of the bolt line.

# Location
On the left side of Walt's Wall, just to the right of Paradicey.

# Protection
Bolts, two-bolt anchor at the top.
