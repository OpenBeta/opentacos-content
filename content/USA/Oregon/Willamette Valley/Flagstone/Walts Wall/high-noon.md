# Description
A slabby climb using friction and edges.  Climb up and left until you reach a shallow left-facing dihedral.  Climb easier ground in the dihedral to a small ledge with two sets of belay bolts.

# Location
The route starts on the left side of Walt's Wall, just uphill of a stump (see beta photo on the Walt's Wall area page).  Look for a line of bolts that curves up and left.

# Protection
Bolts, two-bolt anchor at the top.
