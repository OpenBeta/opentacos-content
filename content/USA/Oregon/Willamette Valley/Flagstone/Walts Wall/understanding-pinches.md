# Description
This varied route starts with a thin slab, then moves up and left through a slightly overhanging section with underclings, pinches, mantles...a bit of everything.  The crux is near the top, climbing past a thin flake.  After pulling a small bulge, you can either clip the anchors on the route just to the left (

Beguiled

) or continue up and right (about 30 feet of 5.6 slab) to another anchor.

# Location
On the right hand side of Walt's Wall, near a large stump.  One rope rappel.

# Protection
Bolts, two-bolt anchor at the top.
