# Description
Another slabby climb using friction and edges.  The crux comes near the top, as the route heads left to the same ledge that High Noon finishes on.

# Location
Just to the right of High Noon (see beta photo on the Walt's Wall area page).  Look for a line of bolts with homemade angle iron hangers.

# Protection
Bolts, two-bolt anchor at the top.
