# Description
This route starts with a very thin but well-protected slab crux before ascending up and slightly right into a faint water groove with a fun mix of technical and powerful movement. If you enjoyed Harp of Stone, this is worth a try. Bring your dancing shoes.

# Location
Just right of Harp of Stone, look for a line of bolts ascending a subtle, dark-colored scoop.

# Protection
5 bolts and an anchor
