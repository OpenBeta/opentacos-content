# Description
This route shares the 5.6 dihedral finish with High Noon, but provides a noticably harder start, and will feel hard for the grade. If you are not solid at the grade, a stick clip is probably not a bad idea. For people for whom this is their limit, toproping this with a directional or two after leading High Noon might not be a terrible idea.

# Location
Just right of Solar Evening, this route shares a finish with High Noon, which is the next route to the right.

# Protection
bolts
