# Description
A thin start brings you to ledges then the Harp. A good place to shake out. Continue up, keeping center and left of the bolts makes route finding easier as you pull the bulge (crux). There are chains directly up about 10 feet back. Or you could keep going right , its a little dirty. Very Fun for the grade!

# Location
Walk uphill from hydro tube, after the dark water mark look for the harp shaped block about midway up. First bolt is near a stump.

# Protection
Bolts to the fixed anchors, about 10 draws?
