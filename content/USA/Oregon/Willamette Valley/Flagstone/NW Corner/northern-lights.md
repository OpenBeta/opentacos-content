# Description
If your introducing climbing to a friend, this is a great climb to do so! Pitch 1: Climb the slab past a few 5.8 moves (crux) in the lower section then its a fun haul to the anchors. Pitch 2: Very fun climbing almost gym like on sustained .8/.9. Easy single rope rappels from both sets of chains.

# Location
Walk up to the northern slab and look for the obvious flat ground in a bowl shaped area (Nice staging area). The line you want is the 3rd line from the right on it's own flat starting wall.

# Protection
(15 draws) Bolts to fixed top anchors with rap rings.
