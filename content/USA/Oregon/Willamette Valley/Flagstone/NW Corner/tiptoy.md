# Description
Like the nearby Diamond Slipper, this climb's name let's you know what kind of climbing you are in for on this one, if it wasn't obvious just looking at it. Follow a right-trending diagonal ramp until a couple of bolts protect a turn left up a steep bulge (crux) to an anchor.

# Location
Just right of Toy Box.

# Protection
Bolts.
