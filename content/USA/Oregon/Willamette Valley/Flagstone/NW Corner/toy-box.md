# Description
P1 5.4 use any one of the many grid bolted routes to gain access to the ledge at the base of the second pitch.

P2 5.6 climb up past bolts on the right edge of the wall atop the slabs.

P3 5.5 climb straight up slab to lower anchor, or climb up and left for one very long pitch to the true summit.

# Location
Start at lower end of the slabs.

# Protection
Bolts. This climb can be led entirely on natural gear, use aliens and offset nuts. Also bring a few pieces if going to the true summit.
