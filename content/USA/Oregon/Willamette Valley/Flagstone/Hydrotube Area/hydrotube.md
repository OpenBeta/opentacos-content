# Description
Hydrotube would be a classic climb anywhere and is one of the most unique climbs you'll find in Oregon.

Pitch 1: (5.8+)  Begin up the middle of the obvious tube on well placed bolts.  The crux comes midway up this first pitch with a few friction moves and edges and quickly eases off as the angle decreases.  Belay at ledge to the left of the tube on beefy anchors.

Pitch 2:  Step right from the anchors and climb up a few dicey moves until it eases off considerably.  Continue straight up another steep section (15ft) and scramble to the summit.

Walk off down trail to the right or rappel with two ropes.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Take many draws as the first pitch is long.  All anchors are well bolted.

A 60m will barely make it down from the first pitch anchors.
