# Description
Start out at the base of the Hydrotube.  I generally lead up and clip the first bolt of the tube, then veer right (I don't think it adds much rope drag).  Some say that a #3 Camalot protects a supposed run-out section to the 2nd bolt, but I'd venture to say that it is not that run out, and gear is a waste of time.  Fun slab climbing on good edges and underclings.

A short bouldery crux is thought provoking during the last 3 (very closely spaced) bolts.

One 60m rope works fine if you lower off from the first anchors.

There is a 2nd pitch that climbs a right facing corner but I haven't climbed it.  If you plan on climbing the 2nd pitch bring a small selection of gear to 2".

Walk off, or rappel with 2 ropes.

# Location
Start at the base of the Hydrotube.  Rappel from the first set of anchors w/ one rope or continue up the 2nd pitch w/ two ropes to rappel, or walk off.

# Protection
1st pitch: QD's

2nd pitch: Gear to 2"
