# Description
This is a newer route that is not in the Orton guidebook.

Climb up through underclings and smeary feet to a balancy crux around the third bolt.  After a small bulge, the route moves up and left, following a vast slab for another 100+ feet.  The slab features much easier climbing than the start but offers plenty of opportunities to blow it.  When the angle kicks back even more, belay from a pair of old bolts (these are also the top anchors for

Apache Acid

) or scramble about 30 feet higher and belay from a pair of glue-ins.  It took almost all of a 70m rope to reach the glue-ins, so I'm not sure whether you could go that far on a 60m.

A new intermediate anchor has been added, providing the option of climbing the steeper bottom section and skipping about half of the slab.

# Location
Start left of Acne Problem below a wall of downward-facing flakes.

To descend, walk off by scrambling up and right until you reach the trail near the summit of Flagstone.

# Protection
18 bolts to reach the highest anchor (two glue-ins).  Two lower anchors are also available.
