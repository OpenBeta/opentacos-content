# Description
Climb up into a shallow dihedral, then turn the arête next to it and continue up into another shallow dihedral.  After exiting the second dihedral to the right, the crux pulls a small bulge on edges and sidepulls.  After this, continue up easier slabby terrain to a two-bolt anchor.

The three-dimensional terrain of dihedrals and arêtes makes for some interesting moves on this route.

# Location
Start two bolt lines to the right of Hydrotube, just left of a shallow dihedral.

Rappel with two 60m ropes or one 70m rope.

# Protection
Bolts (about 9) with a two-bolt anchor at the top.
