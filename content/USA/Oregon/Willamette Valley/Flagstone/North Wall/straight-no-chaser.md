# Description
From the Orton Guide, "Continuously overhanging face climbing on edges and liebacks.  Powerful and technical route with rounded slab finish for the last 25 ft.  Excellent route."

There is potential for awkward (mind your ankles!) falls into bulges moving toward 3rd bolt.  Lots of potential for safe big air higher on the route.  Top out slab is VERY dirty.  Tred lightly.

# Location
Two routes left of Joy Luck Club.  Look for a chain on second bolt.
