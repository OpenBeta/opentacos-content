# Description
A shallow slab and a few bolts bring you to the start of a steep slab that is dipping at a weird angle and makes for an interesting lead. When you hit a blank section try to mantle and grab a nice hold (possible crux). The head wall is slightly overhanging on good holds. Single rope rappel.

# Location
Locate a tree midway up in the bowl shaped area, then look for the obviously cleaned bolted route to the left of the tree.

# Protection
Bolts to fixed anchors with rap rings.
