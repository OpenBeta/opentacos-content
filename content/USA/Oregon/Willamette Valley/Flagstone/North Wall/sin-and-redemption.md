# Description
Long moves between mostly positive holds.  You'll pull down on a bit of everything and encounter more than one crux along the way.  The actual crux will likely depend on climbing style/size etc.  Movement is quite fun once you get the sequences worked out.

# Location
Directly left of Straight No Chaser.  Belay is not ideal, given angle of landing.

# Protection
Bolts
