# Description
The name says it all! Locate the lowest pair of anchors on the eastern most side of the north slab(for belay). Run up the easy slab clipping a few bolts if desired heading towards the blankest section of slab in the bowl area. A tricky mantle right off the low angle slab sets the tone for the rest of the climb. Pitch 2: 5.9 looks easy, but keeps you on your toes, at the 3rd bolt dog left, pull a bulge and continue on easy terrain to the summit.

# Location
Look for a tree midway up on the northern slab/bowl area. Now look  down and to its right at a very clean and smooth section of rock. A suggested way down as there are no rings on these anchors is to scramble down the summit to your right (there's a bolt if you get worried) and find a pair of anchors with rings. Two rope rappel, or eye a pair of intermediate chains for single.

# Protection
Bolts to fixed anchors (no rap rings).
