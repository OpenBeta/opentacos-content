# Description
Follow a seam up to a face with decent holds. This leads to the first crux which is a clip on a small crimp and then pulling over a diagonal edge.  The route heads straight up to some overhanging huecos, pumping, but good holds.  The route finishes on a lower angle slab which is likely the real crux.  You can attack it from a few different directions.

# Location
From the trail to the top of Main Street follow the gulley to the right down the cliff.  The route starts past a fallen tree.

# Protection
8 bolts with a double bolted anchor on top.  Be mindful of rope drag.
