# Description
A highly diverse route. One of my favorites from my visit to Hills Creek. Climb the crack to a corner and veer left up and over a bulge to finish the climb as the steep lessens.  All sorts of different techniques and rock formations on this one.

# Location
The trail leads to the top of Main Street, on the left side you will find two sets of anchors.  East End Boys is the right set.  Rappelling down will save you a hairy approach down the cliff.  Use the single bolt belay at the top of the low angle slab.

# Protection
There are top rope anchors accessible from the trail.  If you want to lead, it uses roughly 8 bolts and a #2 Camalot in place of the second bolt, which is likely a must have to avoid decking.
