# Description
A solid 5.11a - more technical than physical. first challenge is mantling the overhang. above are thin holds, steep balancing moves required. a bit dirty. there’s a belay bolt to clip at the base.

# Location
As the trail comes to the Spires, you’ll see the large Main Street spire directly below (south) and to your right (west). Go to the right, scrambling out past the manzanita tree. Make 2 5.7 moves to bring you to top of Main Street. The second set of anchors on your left will bring you down Draggin the Gut. Alternatively, you can take the left hand trail down but rappelling is recommended.
