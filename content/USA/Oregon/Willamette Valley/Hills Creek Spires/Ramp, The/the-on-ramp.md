# Description
Harder than it looks. Follow line of 5 bolts to the top of the ramp and a small ledge, sorta run out to the first bolt. Crux comes at about the 2nd bolt. To get to the top of the formation you have to do a very short bouldery 5.9 move with no pro except the anchor.

# Location
Line of bolts up the obvious ramp.

# Protection
5 bolts + Anchors with rap rings.
