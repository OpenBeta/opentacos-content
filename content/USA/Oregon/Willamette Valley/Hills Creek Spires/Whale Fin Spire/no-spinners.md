# Description
This is a relatively short route up the north face of the Whale Fin Spire. It is currently the only route on this formation. As of March 2021, the route is mostly covered in moss. Thus, the crux is trying to find the holds underneath the moss. It will likely stay this way until it sees consistent traffic. There is a single belay bolt at the base of the route. The route is short and low angle, with the real crux likely coming straight off the deck. The first bolt on the route can be clipped from the ground by someone with a long reach to protect the leader from taking a tumble off the saddle. While the route itself is not all that exciting (especially in its mossy state), those who venture down to the Whale Fin to climb it will be rewarded with excellent views of Diamond Peak to the southeast and Buddha's Throne to the southwest, not to mention the reward of topping out a little climbed spire.

# Location
The route begins at a single belay bolt on the north side of the Whale Fin Spire. See area description for access information.

# Protection
5 bolts to chain anchors
