# Description
A long, amazingly consistent face climb of 10a moves all the way to the top.  If you like the grade it's not to be missed, but the repetitive moves also get boring.  The crux is gaining access to the arete right off the belay ledge.

# Location
Approach from the gully between The Arete and Main Street to a belay on a ledge with a madrone tree. Or rappel from top anchors accessed from short, although precarious) route on the saddle at top of spire (See area description before attempting).  FIND THE CENTER OF YOUR ROPE before rappelling.

# Protection
10 Bolts to double bolted anchors. Watch for sharp volcanic rock.
