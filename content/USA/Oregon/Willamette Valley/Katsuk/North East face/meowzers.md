# Description
Right crack of a dual crack dihedral running up one of the small columns protruding from the Northeast face.  Starts with fingers and hand jams; moves into lieback; finishes with offwidth.

Tree anchor is to the left of column approximately 50% up the entire Northeast face.

Note: using the offwidth left crack in addition to the right for hands would drop the grade.

# Location
Approximately in the middle of Northeast formation.  Around 7 columns to the right of the "phalanges" looking formation (see pic).

# Protection
Gear used to sew it up (in approximate order): BD 0.75 (green), BD 0.5 (purple), BD #1 (red), BD #1 (red), BD #2 (orange), BD #3 (blue), T 0.5 (black), M MasterCam #8 (purple).

Notes:

The offwidth section near the top has a small horizontal pocket for a BD #3 (or a M #8 like I used).

A BD 0.4(gray), an extra BD #2, and a BD #6 might be useful for some.

Anchor: Two 1" webbing with rap ring to the left of route around tree (forgive the neon color: I hope that this is temporary).

BD = Black Diamond

M = Metolius

T = Totem
