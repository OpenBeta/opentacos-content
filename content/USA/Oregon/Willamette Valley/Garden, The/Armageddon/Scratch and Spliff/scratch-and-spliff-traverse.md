# Description
A long and fun traverse! Start low down on the right, matched on a hollow sounding jug, pull on and gain the crack, traverse from right to left until the easy top out on slopers and edges. Very fun and worth doin, a good warmup for some of the harder climbs in the area. Various top out options for increased difficulty.

# Location
Walk around the right side of the block and youâ€™ll note the overhang. This line starts down right.

# Protection
Typical Gardens landing
