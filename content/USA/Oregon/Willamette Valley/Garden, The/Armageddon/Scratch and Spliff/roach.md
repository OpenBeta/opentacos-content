# Description
Simple warm up problem. Stand start on good edges and head straight up using a crack and some good side pulls and edges. Would be a great beginners problem if not for the terrible landing.

# Location
Right of Scratch and Spliff Traverse, on the clean face, furthest right line possible on the block.

# Protection
Typical Gardens landing
