# Description
This short little trad line holds the distinction of being the easiest line on the wall. It could be punched through the roofs, but we've elected to consider it done where the trad protection ends, and keep it at a easier grade.

This proud line features two (that's right, TWO) hand jams at the start. Otherwise it's mostly face climbing protected by gear.

The anchor currently is the fixed steel draw of the 5.12 to the right, clipped off an undercling under the roof below the draw.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Gear from 0.3-2". Smaller gear (thin nuts) could supplement the main pieces if desired. For the anchor, clip the hanging steel draw up and right. You can clip the draw down and right to complete the anchor.
