# Description
This is the crack climb in the alcove with three bolts in the top half. This spring it has been the home to several hundred wasps that seem to have gone away. It takes a .75 and a .3 C4 for the crack, blue TCU is also nice. Three draws for the bolts and two more for the anchors. Rap rings to get down.

The crux is clipping the anchors off of a crimp.

# Location
Right of Fight Club Obvious finger crack. Rap rings on top.

# Protection
5 draws, single rack to 0.75 C4, no wires needed.
