# Description
This is the only completely bolted climb from before the current wave of development. It goes up this super beautiful looking arrete feature that is quite overhung and quite blank looking. I do not think that it has been climbed before because it had single biners on every bolt and a rotten rope hanging from it. You should give it a go.

# Location
Starts on the ledge above the lowest area. There is a fourth class ramp about 20 feet left of the start or a crack that runs directly up to it. Both tend to be dirty.

# Protection
Looks like all bolts, anchor at the top only has one rap ring as far as I can tell.
