# Description
This route starts on the right side of the Scorpion's Revenge pillar, heads right up the crack system, then steps left and up the little corner. The crux is the sloper moves in the move left, though the top out is quite technical to get high enough to get to the good hold.

This route has been heavily cleaned. I worked hard to make sure that dirt won't seep down it in the rain but it will take a while to get all of the dust and grit off of the top. Expect dust and bring a brush. This route was originally put up on gear but has since been bolted. It didn't get enough traffic to stay clean.

# Location
Starts on the right side of the Scorpions Revenge pillar. Climb right onto the treed ledge. The line is quite obvious due to the scrubbing it has received. An anchor can be set up in crack at the top of the climb. Use the anchors on Scorpion's Revenge to get down. I don't recommend using them for TR'ing the route.

# Protection
Single Rack to #2. A #2 and .5 for the anchor up top.
