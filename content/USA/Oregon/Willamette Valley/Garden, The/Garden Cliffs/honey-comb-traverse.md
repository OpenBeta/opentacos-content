This starts on Criss Cross but traverses way right to the right facing corner. Then go right and finish on the anchors of My Empire of Dirt. Currently fixed most of the way with permadraws.

# Location
At the top of the stairs. Same start as Criss Cross but keep traversing right.

# Protection
Bolts. Quick clips at the top.
