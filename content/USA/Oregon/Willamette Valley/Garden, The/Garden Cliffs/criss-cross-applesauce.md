# Description
Funky moves to get off the ground. Pumpy traverse and then strait up for a cryptic crux. After that, it is almost all fun jugs to the top.

The fourth bolt may need to be skipped to send the crux sequence but can be used to work the moves.

# Location
Starts at the top of stairs.

# Protection
7 bolts with rap rings.
