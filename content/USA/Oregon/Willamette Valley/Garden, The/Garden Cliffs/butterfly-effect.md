# Description
OPEN PROJECT.

Newly bolted, this line just got cleaned, and it's  above my pay grade right now... Some really tough moves on this one. Should be a great route (if it can go now). Feel free to project on it. I've worked it, and it is HARD! I'm guessing somewhere in the hard 5.13 area. It is an open project.

Technical, powerful climbing on big moves and small holds on a vertical wall with almost no footholds.

# Location
Right of slithering skink

# Protection
7 bolts.
