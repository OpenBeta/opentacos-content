# Description
This is the 5 star route here and a must do!

Climb up good holds on the right side of the "cave" to a large hold about 30' up. Pull a quick cruxy move, and shake out. Work up to a high clip and then figure the unique crux out, requiring both technique, power and compression. Get a final shake on the jug, and then finish the last pumpy moves to the anchor. A surprisingly sustained route, despite the several good holds and (mostly) vertical terrain.

# Location
third route to the left.

# Protection
8 bolts plus two for the anchor. Rap Rings on the anchor.
