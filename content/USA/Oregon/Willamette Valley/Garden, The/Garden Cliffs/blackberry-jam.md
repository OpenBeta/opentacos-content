# Description
This is the obvious crack between Anaphylactic Shock and Learning to Fly. Follow the crak in the back of the flare up then escape out right and up to the next crack that leads to the anchors. The firs crux comes a few moves into the climb when the crack narrows down. The last crux is the lack of feet on the top crack before the long clip to the anchors.
