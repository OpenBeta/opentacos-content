# Description
This route starts on the huge sloper with tiny feet just right of Nest and under the blocky roof. Move up and right to some jugs then up to the undercling roof crack. The route was bolted to move left into the corner, which is quite technical, but has been sent going straight up the roof, which is quite powerful.

# Location
Just right of Nest. Bolt is over the edge and is a bit tricky to see and stick clip but it is possible.

# Protection
5 bolts, rap ring anchor
