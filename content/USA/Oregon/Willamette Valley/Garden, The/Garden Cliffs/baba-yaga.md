# Description
A short but fun moderate face climb! Use nice side pulls and underclings to move up a less than vertical face, then a slight left on a series of ledges for the finish. Manteling the last ledge may be exciting. 4 bolts and quick clips at the anchor.

# Location
Located in the Fairy tale wall. Start beneath the diagonal seam left of Koscheii, you'll be in front of a medium leaning pine tree.

# Protection
4 Bolts to quick clips.
