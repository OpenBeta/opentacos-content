# Description
This route starts on the platform at the top of the stairs on the left side of the Fairy Tale Wall. It starts in the off width behind the giant block and climbs up on to the ledge then up the obvious weakness. The crux move is finding a few hidden holds that allow pulling on to a second ledge. It is too ledgy to be all that great of a climb but adds a nice easy climb to the cliff.
