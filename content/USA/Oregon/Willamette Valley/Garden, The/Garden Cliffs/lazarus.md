# Description
This route is a link up of the bottom of Stasis Chamber into the top of Wildlings. After grabbing the lip of the large ledge on Stasis Chamber clip a bolt just left of the small vertical crack and traverse left to finish on Wildlings. While this route has the same crux as Stasis Chamber it skips the rest on the ledge and adds about 15' of 5.11 climbing, making redpoints distinctly harder.

# Location
See instructions for Stasis Chamber

# Protection
5 or 6 draws, 1 long sling (for the 3rd bolt)
