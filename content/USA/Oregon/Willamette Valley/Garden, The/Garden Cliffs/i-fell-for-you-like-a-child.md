# Description
Fun slab climbing. Climb up the right edge of the big flake then take a small step right and head straight up the slab. There is a big crystal filled dish just above the flake.

# Location
Walking basically to the end of the trail until you get to the built platforms with the large 'flake like feature in front of the cliff and the open book in the middle of it. This route starts on the right side of that flake and goes straight up, maybe 15 feet right of that open book.

# Protection
6? bolts and quick clips for the anchor.
