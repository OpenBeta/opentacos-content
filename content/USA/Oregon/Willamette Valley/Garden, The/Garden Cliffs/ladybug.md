# Description
The route is short and closely bolted. It may be possible to z-clip. All the bolts prevent bouncing off of the tree right next to the route. Like most of the routes in the area, the route is defined by short sequences that are broken up with really good rests. The middle of the route has a reach to a huge jug that isn't too bad. Moving off of the jug, I used a shallow right hand pinch, a left hand gaston, then a right hand crimp gaston to move my right foot onto the jug. From standing on the jug we used two different ways to pull over the top. I used a jug/side pull that is way out left and is reachy. Or you can palm with the left and smear with the right foot.

# Location
This is the second bolted line on the cliff. It is about 15 feet left of the small cave that marks the far end of the cliff and starts just right of a stand of 3 or 4 deciduous trees.

# Protection
5 bolts to quick clips
