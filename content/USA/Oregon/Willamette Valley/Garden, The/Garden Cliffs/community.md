# Description
Starts in the cave like feature under learning to fly. Getting off the ground is a bit awkward, bit tricky finding the holds to get onto the ramp and then a bit tricky to get off of it.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
6 or 7 bolts. The first bolt is a 1/2 inch shiny stainless steel bolt that is meant to be stick clipped and is a pain to stick clip because of the nut and the overhang.

Can be climbed with a single rack to a #2 including nuts. Anchors at the top with quick clips.
