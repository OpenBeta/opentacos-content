# Description
Several technical cruxes in the lower part of this climb. The climbing eases at the midway with a few mantle moves higher up and some mellow slab to finish.

# Location
The Cabbage Patch is the far right side of the cliff at the end of the trail and to the right of a waterfall that drips in the summer. This route is in a right-facing corner about ten feet to the right of the waterfall and is the closest route to the waterfall on that side as of now.

The route just to the right is a closed project.

# Protection
5 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with quick clips
