# Description
This is the furthest left bolted route on the platform made with the treated timber 4 by 6. It starts just left of A Garden Called Peace. Make reachy and technical moves upward using the vertical moon shaped edge. Move slightly right of the gully and continue up and left, passing by the Hive. To clip the last bolt on the outside face I go right and make a long reach to clip it then make the fairly easy traverse to the left and around the arette. You could bail out right here to the anchors on nest very easily. After stepping left to the arette, I hug the arette to clip the next bolt with the permadraw then step down move on to the left face to climb the slab to the top. A hidden hold way left (left hand side pull) makes the moves at the bottom of this slab 10c.
