# Description
This route is a bit unfortunate. It starts with a V2/3 boulder move to a jug. Which is then followed by some very easy climbing. The anchor for this route can be easily accessed via The Feather of Finist the Falcon. It is nice to have a brush on this route as it gets dirt dropping on it from above.

# Location
This route is right of the jenga pile of blocks that I refer to as Damocles Sword and really close to the lone pine tree near the cliff. It is just left of a new 5.10. We are currently doing a lot of development on this wall so I will update the location as the cliff fills in with routes.

# Protection
3 bolts to anchors
