# Description
This route starts on the bottom and climbs up to the long ledge. Moves up through the overhanging section of gray rock then out left and up the black rock. The top of the route is equipped with permadraws. The technical crux is between the second and third permadraws (the two long ones) the redpoint crux is much higher. Many of the holds on this route are not obvious and the climbing can be very difficult until they are found.

# Location
This route starts in the lowest section of the cliff to the right of the stairs and at the edge of the ledge that runs along the cliff. The start can be identified by the large jug at the bottom.

# Protection
10 Bolts with permadraws on the last seven, quick clips at the top.
