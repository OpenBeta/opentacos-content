# Description
Crux move is exiting the pod. Reachy moves higher up that are fun throws to jugs. I had hoped the route would go on mostly gear but I do not like the quality of the placements behind the flakes in the middle and decided to bolt the whole route rather than having just one gear placement.

# Location
Starts in the pod between Scoprion's revenge and SHiT Bowl Odyssey. Finishes on quick clips for Revenge.

# Protection
Use the Scorpion's Revenge Anchors. All bolts
