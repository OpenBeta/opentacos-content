# Description
The route is a bit of a one move wonder that may be height dependent. It starts out very easy on large steps, moves through a short crux, and then up a fun easy slab. The anchors can be reasonably accessed from the route to the right

# Location
Follow the trail to the terraces at the end. This route starts higher up on the terraces on the smaller terrace right next to the alders and at the top edge of the flake feature. The beginning climbs some step like holds.

# Protection
5 bolts to quick clips
