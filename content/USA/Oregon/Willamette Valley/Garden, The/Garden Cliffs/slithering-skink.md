# Description
I named the route slithering skink because I saw a blue-tailed skink the day I sent it and the route wanders a lot. Â This route has three cruxes. The first is transferring from the right ledge into the right facing corner. The second is a high step long reach left of the corner through the horizontal cracks. The third is moving up the corner from the nice rest ledge. The easiest way is to match the left gaston with a right side pull and stand straight up to grab a nice hold on the ledge.There are a lot of ways to do this route, the easiest is around 10c.

# Location
This route is in the right facing corner just before the trail splits down to the left. There is a large scar and its matching rock at the base of the corner. The route starts right up to the small ledge about 7 feet right of the corner then traverses in just below the first bolt.

# Protection
Bolts with rings at the top
