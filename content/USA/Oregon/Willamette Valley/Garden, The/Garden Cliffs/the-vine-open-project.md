# Description
I bolted this line to dry tool when it is rainy. I have not climbed it cleanly as a mixed line yet because it hasn't been rainy. I tried briefly to rock climb it. The bottom is very hard.

# Location
This starts on the ledge left of Rain Shadow and Wildlings. It is best to belay from the ground. It goes up the tallest steepest part of the wall.

# Protection
All Bolts.
