# Description
4 bolts to anchors. Easy moves off the ground that need some cleaning lead into trickier slab climbing and some technical moves at the top. I'm hoping to move the last bolt lower and add a bolt above it, add a bolt to clip from the ground, and drastically improve the landing. Just right is a monster block that seems pretty stuck.

# Location
This route is the farthest route yet developed. Go uphill about 30 feet left of Koschei.

# Protection
4 bolts to anchors.
