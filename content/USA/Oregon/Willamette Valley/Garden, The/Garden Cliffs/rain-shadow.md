# Description
This route is just left of Wildlings. It starts on the ledge above the staircase that drops down underneath of the huge roof. The route starts making big moves between huge holds on the overhanging choss. Then follow the seam straight up and reach out to the anchors under the roof.  There is a bolted extension that continues out of the roof to the right but it is way beyond my ability. Feel free to give it a go.

# Location
Just left of wildlings.

# Protection
3 bolts to an anchor. One additional bolt leads to an anchor above the roof. Moves look quite hard.
