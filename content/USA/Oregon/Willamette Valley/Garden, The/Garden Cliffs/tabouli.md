# Description
The crux is probably between the second and third bolt. There are many smearing feet and friction hands. The top out after the third bolt is pretty mellow. The summer of 2019 this route was wet in the mornings but still climbable at the grade.

# Location
Follow the trail to the third large cliff. This cliff is split by a waterfall. There are steps up just after crossing a downed log. This route is to the right of these steps. This is the left facing corner just left of the big blob of rock. The starting holds include a nice big horn.

# Protection
4 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with quick clips.
