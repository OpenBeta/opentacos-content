# Description
Cool 5.10 climbing up to the overhang. Work out and up to the start of the steep moves at the 2nd hanging draw, and power through pretty good holds to a large fin jug. Once there, figure out the final technical crux to the anchor! This climb has a large variety of different styles packed into it. Rad route and well worth sending!!

FYI: At the start of the overhang is a large block/jug that may move if grabbed wrong. I've tried multiple prybars to get it out, and had no luck, so it's in there good.

# Location
Pretty obvious route going through a steep overhang, with fixed draws on it. On the upper section of the cliff, 5th or 6th route from the trail

# Protection
bolts. Will have fixed draws
