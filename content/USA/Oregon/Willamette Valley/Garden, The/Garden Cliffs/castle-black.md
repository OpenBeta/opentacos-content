# Description
Charge up the easy finger crack to the ledge and lay siege to the steep corner above. Cool stem moves on good rock lead to a powerful crux requiring a commiting reach. From there gallavant up the crack to a final mantle onto the ledge.

This section of the cliff seeps heavily and is the last area to dry in the summer. As of July 4 there was only one slimy hold but not really an issue. As with most routes here it's a good idea to bring a brush along, especially if you might be the first one up the route for the season.

# Location
Left side of the cliff at the lowest point. Right facing corner in the black rock.

# Protection
Bolts. This route was originally led on gear (PG13).
