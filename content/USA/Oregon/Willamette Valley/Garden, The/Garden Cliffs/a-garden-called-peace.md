# Description
This route laybacks up the large flake feature. Stepping into the corner left of the flake prevents any bad falls near the first bolt. The crux comes between the third and fourth bolts reaching to a jug from a slopey hand then mantling onto a slab. An extension and a route to the left are in the works.

# Location
Follow the trail to the far left end of the cliff on top of the ledge. Lower off of quick clips.

# Protection
5 bolts, quick clip anchor
