# Description
This route starts about five feet right of A Garden Called Peace and moves straight up through a series of small roofs with high step mantles. The crux is at the first bolt.

Depending on the length of your draws they may hang with the biner over the edges of the roofs, which could put some nasty forces on them if you fell.

# Location
The first bolt is very high, is meant to be stick clipped and is hard to see, but it is up there. Lower off of the quick clips.

# Protection
6 bolts.
