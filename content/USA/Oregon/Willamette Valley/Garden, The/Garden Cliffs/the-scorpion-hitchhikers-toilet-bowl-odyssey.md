# Description
After I climbed this route my wife told me about the discover and disposal of a scorpion that was climbing on the towel in the bathroom. I imagine it rode all the way home in the cuff of my pants. The scorpions in the area are not really toxic, 1 out of 5, and seldom sting. This is the line left of the tight corner, as of right now it is the second climb you come to. It starts under the small roof and goes up the left facing crescent feature. The crux is at the third bolt which is best clipped from the jug above and left of the bolt. The bolt just below the ledge is a tough clip from the jugs but not too bad from the holds under it. I intend to move the first bolt left because stick clipping it sets up the potential for a pendulum fall into the roof.

# Location
This route is about ten feet right of the cave that is at head height and maybe 15 feet left of the short pedastel.

# Protection
Bolts. Rap rings on top.
