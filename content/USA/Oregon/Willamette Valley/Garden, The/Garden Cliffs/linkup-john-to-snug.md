# Description
This is a bit convoluted but avoids all of the most difficult bits on several routes. Start on the right side of the pillar as for John Henry's Hammer. Then move out left below the crimpers making a long left reach to a jug to get onto Snug as a Snail and follow it to the top. This move left is the crux though the climbing higher up is a bit tricky as well.

# Location
Start as for John Henry

# Protection
Bolts and quick clips for the anchor
