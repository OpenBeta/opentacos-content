# Description
This is the first bolted route you come to as you approach the cliff. You can stick clip the first or the second bolt. First bolt is in a less than optimal spot due to hollow rock on the right side, so if you can reach the 2nd bolt, clip that one.

Boulder a quick crux (V2ish) off the ground to a ledge, then move up and left on technical and thin moves (another V2ish crux) through the next bolt. Then head up to good holds and a quite dynamic crux getting to a weird "bulb" jug. Then immediately pull the hardest, and last crux (look for a nifty kneebar) to a good hold and easier moves to the top.

The grade of this route is still very much up in the air. So give suggestions once you climb it!
