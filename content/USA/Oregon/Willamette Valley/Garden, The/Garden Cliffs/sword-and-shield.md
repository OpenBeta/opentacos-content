# Description
Furthest right route. Currently a closed project. I put in two bolts without getting on it many times and they may need to be moved. Above the roof the holds peter out and the climbing gets hard

# Location
Farthest right end of the cliff starts next to a small cave/roof.

# Protection
2 bolts to quick clips.
