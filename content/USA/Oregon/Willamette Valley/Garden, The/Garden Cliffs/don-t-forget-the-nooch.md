# Description
This is super cruiser but some of the rock is a bit soft. It will take a little while to clean up. I cleaned it in the hopes that it will be a nice first lead or a pretty chill route for families.

# Location
This is the furthest right route at the Cabbage Patch. Get there by following the trail to the third cliff and going up the steps, likely overgrown, after the log across the trail.. Go up the 'stairs' to the rotten stump and hang a right. It is on the right side of the large blob of andesite and is a left-facing corner. It should be pretty obvious from the trail on the walk in.

# Protection
3 bolts to anchors with rap rings. Currently the rap rings are on biners. I'll upgrade it when I get out there again.

I think the rap rings were stolen. I haven't been able to get over to this part of the cliff and fix the anchors.
