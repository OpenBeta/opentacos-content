# Description
My Empire of Dirt starts as for Nachash. At the bottom of the stairs, at the lowest level. Cimb through the lower crux of Nashach. Clip the sixth bolt then head out left through overhanging terrain. The route goes straight up following the bolts from there. It is a long sequence of moves with very marginal rests to a V3/4 boulder move before it eases off. The second to last bolt is tricky to clip and may be moved.

There is the possibility of linking up to the project to the left, but please don't do that until that project is opened up.

# Location
Starts as Nachash and then cuts left just after the crux of that route.

# Protection
11 bolts +2 for the anchor. 6 bolts are currently fixed with permadraws.
