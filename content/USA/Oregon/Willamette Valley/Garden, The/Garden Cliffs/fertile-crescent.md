# Description
This is the left line of two routes that start on the left side of the cliff about 30 feet left of the stairs below Criss Cross between the two large trees. The two routes finish on the same anchor at the ledge. The two routes share the same finish. It moves up the crescent-shaped feature via a nice pocket and big undercling and then pulls through the roof at the top. I found the sequence to be very cryptic. The feet to the left of the crescent are tiny. There are several ways to pull through the roof, some are much harder than others. The route finishes on the ledge.

There are two more bolts heading up to the top of the cliff. The climbing here is okay but I think there is potential for a hard fall onto the roof feature so I never finished this line. The holds end before the anchors.
