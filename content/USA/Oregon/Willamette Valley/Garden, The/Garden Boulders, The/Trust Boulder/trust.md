# Description
Obvious overhanging boulder above Mole. Follow the crack up to jugs. The block looks like it could fall out but I am pretty sure it is solid.. Crux move is grabbing and moving off the good sloper on the rail. Bump left then way up over to a jug crack at the top.

# Location
The inner sanctum

# Protection
2-3 pads. This fall could hurt.
