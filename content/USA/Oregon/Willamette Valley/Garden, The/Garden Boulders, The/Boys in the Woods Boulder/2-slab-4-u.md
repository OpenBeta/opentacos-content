# Description
Middle line on the Tree Slab Boulder, starts on two left facing crimps. Head up to two crimps/gastons then some terrible left hand slopers and top out off the jug on the very top of the right arete. This problems avoids both aretes, that means no good left foot on the top of left arete start hold and no slapping right hand on the right arete. Grade still up in the air so jump on it and give it a rating!

# Location
Follow the second path from the road, the boulder is on the left side of the trail with a tree near the right arete, near an intersection with a path that leads south.

# Protection
At least 2-3 pads, more is better.
