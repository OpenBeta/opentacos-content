# Description
Starts with right hand on arete and left hand on the right hand crimp from 2 slab 4 u. Follow the arete up and top out, very straightforward problem. Grade still very much up in the air, climb it and submit a grade!

# Location
Follow the second path from the road, the boulder is on the left side of the trail with a tree near the right arete, near an intersection with a path that leads south.

# Protection
At least 2-3 pads, more is better.
