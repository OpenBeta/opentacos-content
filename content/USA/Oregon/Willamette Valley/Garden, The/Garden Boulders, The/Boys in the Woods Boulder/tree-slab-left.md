# Description
Starts on left arete and right hand sidepull, fairly obvious. Proceed upwards using the arete for the left hand and some small crimps and slopers for the right. Ledge halfway up the arete makes the top out a lot less sketchy. Grade is still up in the air so climb it and let us know what you think!

# Location
Follow the second path from the road, the boulder is on the left side of the trail with a tree near the right arete, near an intersection with a path that leads south.

# Protection
At least 2-3 pads, more is better.
