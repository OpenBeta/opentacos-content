# Description
A fun vertical highball.  With a couple of spotters and a few crashpads the fall isn't too bad, but since the crux comes at the final throw over the lip it is a bit intimidating.

Some day the flake that forms the lefthand undercling at the top is going to rip off which will probably make this quite a bit harder.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
A few crashpads and a spotter or two.  The landing looks a lot worse than it really is, and becomes much more reasonable with a few pads.
