# Description
Just as classic as the stand. Start on slopped left hueco and thigh level sidepull undercling. Confusing and deceptively simple beta will lead you to the boobs and eventually up the arete. This can feel much harder with the more intuitive Â and easy to read beta! Somewhat hieght/Span dependent.

# Location
left of silly steep mantle

# Protection
couple of pads at least 2
