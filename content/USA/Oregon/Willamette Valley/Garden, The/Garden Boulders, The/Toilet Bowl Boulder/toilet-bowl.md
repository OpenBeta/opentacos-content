# Description
This is the first boulder you come to as you walk in on the trail from the road. It's fairly small, about 10' tall. Several lines on it, and its my typical warm up for the rest of the boulders.

If you start sitting with both hands on the smaller undercling, and work up to the topout, it's about V3. Several other standing starts are in the V0-V2 area.

# Location
First boulder you get to as you walk into the Garden from down below at the road.
