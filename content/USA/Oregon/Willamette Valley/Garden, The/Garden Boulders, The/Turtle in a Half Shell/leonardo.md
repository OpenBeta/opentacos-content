# Description
Sit start under the right hand corner of the boulder(downhill side) with hands matched on a decent sloper shelf. One big move up and left to a crux side pull, work your feet up until you can mantle the corner, simple but still dirty topout.

# Location
While walking up the left trail this is the first problem you will approach on the first climable boulder. Look for the sloper shelf under the corner, this is the start.

# Protection
2ish pads
