# Description
Sit start with hands matched on a great large sloper at the lip. Move right to a good incut corner with good feet, use a high left foot and rock over on to the slab(crux), simple top-out.

A fun problem for the V1-2 climber, worthwhile warmup for others.

# Location
On Turtle in a half Shell boulder.

Right of the large obvious crack.

Sit start matched on the obvious chalked sloper shelf.

# Protection
A bit difficult to protect with the large rocks in the landing.
