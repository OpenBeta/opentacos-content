# Description
Sit start left of the hole/pit of death. The sit start is awkward, do one hard move to gain the left arete, work up using the face and left arete til the apex, then topout. Kinda fun little problem.

# Location
Kinda above bitchin corners, kinda to the right of Jerry Curl/Cuba Gooding, kinda below the good v3

# Protection
Don't fall in the pit
