# Description
Fun little climb, start inside the crack and wedge your way up. Lots of alternatives and fun ways to climb this one (like upside down). Still a little bit dirty but Iâ€™m sure after I go and scrub it somemore and people start using it will become a nice addition to the Garden.

# Location
Little cave just left of Gumby slab.
