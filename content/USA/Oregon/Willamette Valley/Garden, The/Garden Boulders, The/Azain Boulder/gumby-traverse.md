# Description
Theres a nice traverse on the gumby slab that I've never seen shared before or listed in either guidebook.

Start on the gumby arete and traverse from left to right finishing up gumby crack. Avoid the excellent flat hand shelf or it degrades the problem to a V0

# Location
Gumby slab.

Back back.

On the Azain Boulder right of garden variety and the siren.

# Protection
Flat landing, on of the best in the gardens.
