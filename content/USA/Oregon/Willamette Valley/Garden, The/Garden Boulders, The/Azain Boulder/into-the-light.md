# Description
There are many cave systems that run under the boulders of the Garden; one such smaller cave beneath the Azian boulder houses a V-hard steep problem that makes it way out of the cave floor to top out above the base of Azians Crack.  If you find yourself in a  large set of caves with multiple entrances and exits, wrong cave.  Into The Light has a very small cave thats typically littered with beer cans.
