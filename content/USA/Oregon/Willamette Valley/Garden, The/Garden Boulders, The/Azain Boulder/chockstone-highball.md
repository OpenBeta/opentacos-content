# Description
Starts on a blocky section under the obvious white prow. Move up and left. Climb really starts at the transition onto the prow. Potentially a bad fall from these first few moves. Big holds out to the end of the prow then up over the top.

# Location
Block to the right of the warm-up slab by Siren.

# Protection
3 or more pads. At least two spotters.
