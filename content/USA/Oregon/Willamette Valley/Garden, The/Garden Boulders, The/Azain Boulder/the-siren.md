# Description
An excellent problem with a lot of movement. Works up the stand alone prow near Garden Variety. Start low and heal out right on a good ledge. From there work up to the inverted V pinch and left to the arete. From there it is a long committing move to the slopers on the top. For the topout there is a ledge/jug that is a little hard to find but makes it easier. Not a bad idea to go check out the topout before hand and locate the hold as it is a bit high to fall from there.

# Location
Right of Garden Variety.

# Protection
At least 3 pads as this problem works the prow hard right to left.
