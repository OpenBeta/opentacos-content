# Description
A fun powerful sidepull problem.  The starting holds are a bit of a reach so stacking a few pads will help.  Put your feet on the obvious rail/crimp and slap up through to the top.

There

might

be some potential for a wicked lower start to this problem off of the starting footholds but it'd probably go at V10+.

# Location
This problem is on the overhanging wall in the very back off the main trail. It starts near the middle on a pinch about 7ft. up.

# Protection
Crashpad
