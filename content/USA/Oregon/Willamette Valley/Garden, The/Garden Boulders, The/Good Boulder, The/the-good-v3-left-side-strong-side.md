# Description
Have yet to see anyone post this problem on here, even after almost 3 years of climbing at the gardens, so here I am. Apparently the original name is "The Good V3", but I have always called it "Left side, Strong side", and I've introduced it to other people as that, so I'll just put both in the title for the sake of hopefully eliminating any confusion. Don't know who got the FA, so if they, or anyone else knows, feel free to comment it below. That being said, this is a solid climb at the gardens. Starts on a right facing flake and goes up to crimps and slopers. Different betas for the last reachy move, either keep bumping left hand or use some right heel scum action and/or some intermediate slopers to get there.

# Location
Northeast of Octernal. If you take the second entrance to the boulders from the road, follow the path until you reach the left-hand turn for Octernal. Boulder is directly ahead and slightly to the right, it's on the left side of the path, pretty flat landing zone.

# Protection
1-2 pads, probably a spotter as well
