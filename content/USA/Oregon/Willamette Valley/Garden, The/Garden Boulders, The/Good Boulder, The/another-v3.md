# Description
Balancey arete that is more next to "The Good" than "Next to the Good". There are several ways to start this problem, I recommend starting on a thin right hand crimp near head height at the center of the boulder and a lower left hand side pull. From here traverse left onto the arete and continue to the top of the boulder. It's possible to skip an otherwise spicy top out by stepping left into a mini gully thing, you gotta stay on the rock for full value though.

# Location
Left arete on the same bolder as "The Good" immediately to the right of "Next to the Good". Look for a ~15' boulder on the main trail approx 100 yards from the road.
