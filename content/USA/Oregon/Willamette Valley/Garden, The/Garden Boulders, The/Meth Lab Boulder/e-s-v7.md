# Description
This thing seems hard for v7 but what do I know I haven't gotten it yet. Start matched on a crimp rail at chest height. Make a deep lock off right to a positive hold and finish out the boulder with a couple more manageable moves on bad holds. It's kinda fun

# Location
Gently overhanging face to the right of Octernal
