# Description
Stand start to Smackdown. Start on the good right facing jug and get your left on the side-pull crimp or good undercling. Let me know if the grade is wrong, I just went with the pdf guidebook and I know its a few years old now.

# Location
Leftmost side of the boulder with Octernal on it. Huge pitÂ underneath.

# Protection
Bring enough pads to stuff the pit
