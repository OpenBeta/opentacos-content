# Description
Start with your hands crossed low on the diagonal crack. Do some crossing and use some heel/toe hooks to move left along the crack to a decent left hand pinch and a throw to the good crystal in the dish. From there an undercling/sidepull gets you to gaston crimps and out onto the face, next few moves are crimpy, with jugs for the topout. There is no rest to be had anywhere really, there is a pretty big move on the face, and the landing is absolute trash. Mental game has to be on point for this one.

# Location
To the left of Leave it to Jesus, just to the right of the big crack in the middle of the Meth lab boulder.

# Protection
10 pads minimum.
