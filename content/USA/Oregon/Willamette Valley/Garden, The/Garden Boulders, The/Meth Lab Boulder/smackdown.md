# Description
Stand start on undercling pinches or an optional left hand crimp and move up through a good right hand pinch and lateral crimps to a fun top out. Tenuous feet and movement characterize this boulder. Movement feels a solid notch harder than Octernal.

# Location
Leftmost route on the octernal wall. Start is about 5 feet left of the octernal topout.  Line is often wet.

# Protection
At least 2 pads. More isn’t a bad option since the landing is covered in roots and small rocks
