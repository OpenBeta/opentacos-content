# Description
Begin as for Octernal, but avoid the pumpy traverse after the lip by transitioning onto the right side face and climbing straight up into a spicy top out.

Probably easier than the main route since it skips the traverse, the crux of both routes comes before the lip though.

# Location
On the meth lab boulder opposite the road

# Protection
Pads
