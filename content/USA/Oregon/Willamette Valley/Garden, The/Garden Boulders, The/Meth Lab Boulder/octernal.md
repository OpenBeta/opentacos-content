One of the most popular boulders in the garden.  Start low in the cave, left hand sloper and right hand on a small crimp SDS.  Grunge your way up a hard v7/8 to a small heel hook rest.  Then traverse left on a rail system to the left most side of the boulder, traverse around 20 ft to the left after completing the initial cave.

If you start standing with both hands on the large undercling, the line goes at about V5/6.
