# Description
Start low matched on the crimp rail. Work two or three easy moves up on the good hands and poor feet. Dunk on the sloper up and right. A high foot leads to an easy topout.

An old classic from the early 2000s, covered with moss for years and recently re-cleaned. Superb rock quality and movement. Its only flaw is that its so short.

Safe with one pad, but take care not to dab on it.

# Location
In the pass on the West side of the Meth Lab Boulder. A steep overhang on the north side of the pass. Start with feet all the way down, hands matched on the lowest crimp rail (about 1 full pad, not the larger rail up and to the right). This is not on the meth lab boulder itself, but the boulder across the trail from the meth lab.

# Protection
One pad is all you need.
