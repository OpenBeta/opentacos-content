# Description
From the guidebook: "Start on a flat rail at head height and move up and left to top out on the left face."

Note: It seems that this line doesnâ€™t exist and is just a holdover from a previous guide that incorrectly put the climb there. If climbed, it would be significantly harder than v3.

# Location
Boulder #10 in the guidebook. Part of the first densely packed section just up and left from the entrance.

# Protection
1 pad
