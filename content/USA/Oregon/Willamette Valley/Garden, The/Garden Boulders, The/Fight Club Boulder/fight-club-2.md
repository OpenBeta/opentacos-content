# Description
Sit start matched on the slopey lower left arete of the Fight Club boulder and climb right, finishing as for Fight Club. This one's significantly harder and a bit more morpho than the right side line.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
A few pads. You start on a rock jutting up from the ground, which would make for an uncomfortable (but safe) fall at the beginning.
