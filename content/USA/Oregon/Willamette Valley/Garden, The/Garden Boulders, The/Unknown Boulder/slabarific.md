# Description
Despite a committing move near the top at around 15' this is a decent warm-up.  Descend off the left of the boulder.

Someone put a couple of bolts at the top of this so I suppose it could be toproped.

# Location
On the back side of the second enormous boulder from the parking lot.

# Protection
Crashpad
