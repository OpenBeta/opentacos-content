# Description
From the Guidebook: "Start with feet on the lower block. Climb up and right through compression."

Start as best I could figure out was right hand sloper and left and crimp rail (marked by X's). Then move up and right on right hand slopers and left hand crimps to a nice jug for an extremely awkward top out bumping your head on the huge overhanging boulder.

# Location
Right underneath the huge overhanging boulder that has Octurnal on the other side. Boulder #5 if you are looking at the guidebook map.

# Protection
1-2 pads. Spotter would be good for the top.
