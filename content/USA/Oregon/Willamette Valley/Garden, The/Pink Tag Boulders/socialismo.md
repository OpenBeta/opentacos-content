# Description
Stand start outside of the cave and traverse right into the start of Jonah's Dab rig. Top out as for Jonah's dab rig and Workshop 68. Movement looks fantastic!

# Location
First boulder you get to on the trail. It will be on your right.

# Protection
good spotter for the top. You'll be plunging into a hold of boulders if you biff it.
