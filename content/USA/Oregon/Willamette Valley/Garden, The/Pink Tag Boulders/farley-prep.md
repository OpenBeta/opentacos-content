# Description
A decent lowball. It looks dumb (and kind of is) but provides 2 great moves that aren't dabby by Oregon standards. Start right and on the arete crimp and left hand on a thin pinch and a foot in the hole out left. Make a move to a small slot crimp, set you feet and fire for the lip.

# Location
Walk down to the river and go up stream till you reach a large boulder. This line is on the right side of the steeply overhanging face.

# Protection
Pads. More than 1. There is a rounded rock you can land on going for the lip. You can land butt first on it so be sure to pad it.
