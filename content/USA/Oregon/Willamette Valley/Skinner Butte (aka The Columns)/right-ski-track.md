# Description
More of a pure crack climb than its neighbor to the left, this is another worthwhile line at the Columns. I personally found it to be the harder of the two "Ski Track" cracks, with tricky off-balance climbing down low and a thin crux up high.

Note the description and the grade assume you use the crack and the adjacent column faces only, which makes it contrived, but also more interesting.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Cams to 1", protects quite well, but bring some pieces in the fingers and smaller range.
