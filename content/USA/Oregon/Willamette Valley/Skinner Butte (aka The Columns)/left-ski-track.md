# Description
Route starts with fun easy finger jams. Crux is 2/3 the way up the crack. the sequence is tricky for the grade and the feet suck. Crack turns to big hands up top.

# Location
1st crack right of The Chimney

# Protection
Good finger sized pro and maybe a #2 camalot for the top or just TR.
