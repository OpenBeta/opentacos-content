# Description
This climb is the first crack just to the left of the chainlink fence.  The left leaning crack starts with fingers and quickly expands to off-hands size.  Stop at the chains at the top of the small column or continue up and left to the anchor atop Satisfaction.

According to the old timers, this crack is gradually getting wider over the years.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
A few nuts and a single set of cams to a #4 camalot will be more than enough.

Rap from chains at the top or walk off to the north (left).
