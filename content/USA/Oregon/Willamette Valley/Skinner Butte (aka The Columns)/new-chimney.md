# Description
New chimney uses any cracks, stemming and smearing available in the area. This is a fun and simple problem but not too popular.

Fun fact - this area is called the "New Chimney" because back in 1969 a column collapsed forming the chimney feature!

# Location
This route divides the main 5 columns from the wilderness wall to the left, look for the obvious chimney/stem box.

This route is listed as #13 on the Skinner Butte sign board.
