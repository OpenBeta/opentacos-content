# Description
First Column is listed on the sign as 5.11a - 5.12

The route is located immediately left of the main chimney, also left of the large poured concrete block.

The route is super simple til about 10 feet up, then the challenge starts. '

This face climb offers small friction bumps for footholds, right-hand stays fairly dedicated to a side pull on the edge of the column. I believe the difference in grades depends largely upon left-hand placement, I have been told the 11a grade allows the use of the left crack while the harder 12 grade dictates neglecting the crack for a much harder left hand on the face/obtuse corner.
