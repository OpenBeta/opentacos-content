# Description
This is a pretty good climb. Definitely worth doing if you're at "The Columns." Climb the chimney by stemming the entire way up (requires a little more strength), or use a combination of face climbing and crack skills. Crux is near the top, maybe 3/4 of the way up. Gets a little wet and dirty during the rainy season, but other than that, it's usually good.

# Location
Climb the obvious chimney immediately to the right of the main buttress.

This route is listed as #28 on the Skinner Butte sign board.

# Protection
Can be done Trad or TR.  Chain anchors at top.  Small to medium stoppers and cams should be fine.  A note about gear placements; they are a little trickier than it looks from the ground.
