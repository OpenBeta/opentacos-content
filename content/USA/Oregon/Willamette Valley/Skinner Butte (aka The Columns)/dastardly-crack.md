# Description
Climb the lower face for approximately 20 feet to gain access to this short crack.

This dirty little crack sees few ascents, as such it's covered in dirt, it's a little too shallow to really dig in to and a little to thin for fingers in most places if that wasn't enough a fall has a pendulum risk, even on TR... all these factors should make it obvious why this route remains generally unpopular.
