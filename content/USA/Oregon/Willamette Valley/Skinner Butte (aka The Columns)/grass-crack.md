# Description
This is another pretty-good finger crack at the Columns. While graded 5.10b it feels much less sustained than Limp Dick and has a brief but fierce crux. That said, short and tall people will probably disagree on exactly what the crux is, as this route involves both long reaches and high feet. Orton's guidebook calls this 5.9, which seems a bit mean.

# Location
The Ski Tracks and Grass Crack form a trio of finger cracks just right of new chimney, Grass Crack is the one on the right. Just right of Grass Crack is the basically impossible-looking seam of Outer Column No Jam (5.12+?).

# Protection
cams and nuts to 1"
