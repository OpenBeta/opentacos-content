# Description
Speed Crack (also known as Sign Crack) is the left, wider crack on the 4th column.

Climb the face of the 4th column up to the left crack that starts with finger/ring locks and opens to hands near the top.

Stay completely in the crack for a more wild ride. Use small holds on the face close to the crack only if you need to make the climb a bit easier.

In the 60s the city had erected a sign suggesting that permission was required to climb at the area. Hence the name Sign Crack.

This route is listed as #20 and labeled as Sign Crack on the Skinner Butte sign board.
