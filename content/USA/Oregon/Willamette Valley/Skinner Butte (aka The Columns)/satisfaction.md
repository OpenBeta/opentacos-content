# Description
This climb has become a testpiece for locals. Satisfaction is a thin seam up a shallow dihedral. Other routes are sometimes within reach but are considered "off" to get the standard .11 rating. The somewhat contrived line is usually done with a combination of tenuous stemming and tips locks in pin scars. As the season progresses it tends to get harder as the shoe rubber and grime build-up.

If you eschew the face holds and stick to the crack it increases the grade to .12a.
