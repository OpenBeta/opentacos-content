# Description
This is a project ive been working on for a bit now. The route opens with a few face moves on good slopers, this gets you to the crack. This is a super steep rattly fingers crack that requires solid technique and very accurate gear placement as the rock is not uniform and a tad loose, one piece of gear failure will likely result in a ground fall, the angle eases as you go up and the gear gets much better. I highly recommend bringing a long sling or bit of rope to build an anchor on the tree directly above the route and top rope this climb first as it is a quite serious lead at this time, that might change as I clean it more for now I will leave the R rating unless others feel its unnecessary.

# Location
Obvious steep crack.

# Protection
Gear from BD0-BD#1 an extra BD.5-.75 will save your butt. NO ANCHOR top out or build one on the tree directly above.
