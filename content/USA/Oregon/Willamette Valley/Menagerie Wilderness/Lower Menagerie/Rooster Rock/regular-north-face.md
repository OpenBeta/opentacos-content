# Description
Climb moss ramp to corner, clip a bolt and continue up corner to a saddle in the formation. 4th class scramble to the base of a slab. Climb the slab to the anchor. Serious ledge fall potential the whole time.

# Location
north side; closest to the hiking trail.

# Protection
Can be climbed with supplemental gear but you mainly clip gigantic rods that are leftover from the old lookout tower that was once at the summit. Bring yer alpine draws!
