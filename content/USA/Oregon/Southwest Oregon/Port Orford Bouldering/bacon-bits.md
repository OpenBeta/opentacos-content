# Description
Start on the Westside (Ocean Side) of the boulder.

R hand starts on a chest-high sharp undercling, L hand starts with a face high pinch grip/ side-pull. Move your hands up and follow a distinct ledge, keep your body and feet on the slab as you traverse up and to the right. Be cautious as there is some low-quality crumbly rock on the ledge that breaks away and without warning.

# Location
From the parking area walk south on the beach until you reach a cluster of about a dozen free standing boulders.

# Protection
1 spotter and you should be good
