# Description
Walk around the SW side of the boulder and you'll see a faint crack line.

Start R hand chest-high crimp, L hand on a side pull facing the wrong direction. Pull right and follow the crack line straight up delicate moves, complete a simple crux early on and finish in a rewarding top out. You can walk off the back but it's a bit sketchy.

# Location
Immediately right of Bacon Bits

# Protection
1 spotter and you should be good.
