# Description
This classic sport route features 5 bolts and calls for some fun near hand foot matches and expert balance with it’s left to right gymnast like movements.  Don’t miss the mono pocket above the first bolt as you find feet to stand or dyno to the shelved hand hold.  Mantle and use the left finger crack and right arete to pill onto the face before making a committing move and clipping the anchor.  2 bolts with rap rings.

(TR from anchors of “Casey’s Elephant”.  To reduce rope drag at the top rap down from the top and set up on the actual 2 bolt anchors of “Elephant Express”.  Be prepared to top out at “Casey’s” anchors or rap to clean.  Please don’t lower on rap anchors.)

(*NOTE: Clipping the first bolt is a good confidence booster and for practice but a leader fall before the second bolt would be nearly impossible to catch.  Most climbers skip the first bolt altogether.*)
