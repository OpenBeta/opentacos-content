# Description
Directly to the right of “Huggy Bears” start by climbing the short fractured column to the obvious finger crack.  Pull the crack through the overhang and find the thin and shallow upper crack to the left of “Cam’s Jams”.  Single face bolt to the left protects the face. Shares anchors with “Huggy Bears” 2 bolts.

(Use a 240cm sling to extend anchor over the ledge to reduce rope drag for TR.  Use a quickdraw on the face bolt and a #1 cam in the overhang as a directional to keep TR climber from swinging around “Huggy Bears” on a fall.)

# Location
Listed as route 7.) on the wall photo.

# Protection
Protects with #.75-2 cams and a single face bolt to the left of the upper crack.
