Climb the edges to the right of “Boner Direct” past the thin horizontal frack and up the slab to the flare in the gully.  Pull the moves through the flare and gain crack to the right, left of the green/yellow mossy face.  Climb the crack to the top.  (Stem using the slab and you’re fired!)  Finish with bolted anchors, 2 face bolts.

Slightly hard to protect leading up to the flare.
