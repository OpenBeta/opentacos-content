# Description
Easier looking bolted route just left of the “Elephant Wall”.  Follows 5th class moves up a string of safely spaced bolts before topping the column and running out a scramble to the left or right.  Shares bolted anchor with “Schoolhouse” (to the left), or “Elephant Direct” (to the right).

Fun exposure off the right side of the arete.  Top 15 feet are run out but barely 5th class, that being said a fall would be a swinger!  Either bolted anchor has 2 bolts.  TR from the right bolts will not go, set up a TR from the left side anchors shared with “Schoolhouse”.

(TR and lowering off anchors experiences high rope drag.)
