# Description
Possibly the best climb on the wall. Starts on short broken columns leading to the obvious top flaring off-width crack.  Big hand/foot jams up the crack lead to a stem-able overhanging crux.  Pull through the crux and gain a ledge top the column to the left of the crack.  From here use multiple face hold and the arete to climb the face to the right of the crack.  Finishes with a bolted anchor, 2 bolts.

(Use a 240cm sling to extend a TR over the ledge reducing rope drag.)

# Location
Listed as route 8.) on the wall photo.

# Protection
Protect crack with #1-4 cams.  Small cams or various small nuts protect the face.
