# Description
Climb the far left bolted column on balancy ledges past the second bolt.  Get creative from here as the great hold diminish and the roof is unreachable.  Once the "blank" section has been negotiated, powerful moves climb out from under the roof and onto the slab above. Finish on moderate featured slab at the anchors shared with "The Crimp"

# Location
Furthest bolted route to the left when facing the wall.  Listed as 1.) in the route description photo.

# Protection
Slightly reachy first bolt, well protected, bolted anchors.
