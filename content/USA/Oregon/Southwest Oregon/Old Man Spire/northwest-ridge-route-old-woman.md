# Description
From the upper flat between Old Man and Old Woman scramble up a steep scramble trail around the base of Old Woman's west face. When you come to a narrow cleft on the northwest corner of Old Woman sling a tree to establish your fist belay.

Pitch-1: From outside the cleft scramble onto the leg of the northwest ridge leading to the summit of Old Woman. The first 5 feet off the ground can be a little tricky. Once off the ground follow the ridge about 40 feet where you'll find a crack to place a cam. Continue up the ridge placing gear as needed until you come to the bottom of a narrow gully up the left side of the ridge. Establish a belay.

Pitch-2: Climb the gully up the left side of the ridge topping out on a ledge at the summit where you will find a bolted belay without chains.

Rappel to the start of the climb (two ropes).

PG = exposure and leads generally may be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.
