# Description
This problem is on the same boulder as hang ten, it’s the flattest face and has some fun crimps for intermidiate climbers. It starts on two thumb presses with pretty solid feet.

It’s a short but sweet slab problem that moves up to a decent left hand  crimp then a right hand crimp. Then either right or left hand moves to a small jug, then match. The crux is getting good feet at this moment and moving up to the last sharp crimp flake that has one spot that is much more positive than the rest. Set your fingers and slowly move for the top, the back is smooth so you have to feel around for a good hold, move feet up and straddle for the top out.
