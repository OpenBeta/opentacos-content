# Description
Sit start on two jugs, move up the face using pockets, crimps and the right arete. Resist the urge to top out early or pull around the corner, stay on the face and move up for the highest purest top out. A bit of a highball for some.

# Location
If you're standing at straddlesphere this big ugly rock is directly behind you. Start is about 15 feet right of start for caridea.
