# Description
On the boulder farthest to the SE of the bunch, there is an overhanging side about 11 feet high that looks a little bit like a wave. There is a large slopey volume at the base, start with hands on top, with decent feet below. It’s a one move dyno to the top with a preferable two hand catch, hence the name “hang ten” then top out to finish.

# Location
You can’t miss this clump of boulders, if you park on fifth or sixth street in Bandon by the Bandon state natural area. There is a path that leads to the beach from the end of sixth street to about six large boulders, better chance of climbing all at low tide but I think they stay relatively dry most the time.
