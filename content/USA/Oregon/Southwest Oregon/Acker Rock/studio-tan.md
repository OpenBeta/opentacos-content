# Description
Climbs up the "middle tower" of the middle strip of dark patina. Follow seven bolts to the top of the patina. The crux is a move to the left above the second anchor. PG = leads and exposure may not be suitable for someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating. Route can seem a little dirty. The top anchors to the middle tower patina are easily accessed by way of 'Weenie with a Tan' (5.7).
