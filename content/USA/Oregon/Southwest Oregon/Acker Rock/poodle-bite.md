# Description
Both pitches of Poodle Bite offer consistent climbing over quality rock.

Pitch-1 (~120 ft): Climb 20 feet to a somewhat open book inside corner. Follow this feature angling left following bolts and ending at belay anchors.

Pitch-2 (~140 ft): Follow bolts straight up to summit of Observation Rock.

Walk-off.

PG = leads and exposure may not be suitable for someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.

# Location
The start of Poodle Bite is located at a large Douglas-fir just before the obscure Observation Point scramble trail leaves the base of the lower wall and climbs uphill. Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007, topo page 46.

# Protection
Fixe SS 3/8 double expansion, no chains.
