# Description
This route begins from the base of a large Douglas-fir, follows a ledge system to a dirty seam with some loose rock, then follows a crack system to a little enclosure to the right and behind a second Douglas-fir located near the saddle between Lunch Rock and the east headwall of the Peregrine Traverse. Described as having sparse opportunities for placing gear due to crumbly rock. Rappel off from the Lunch Route (150 ft rappel).

# Location
Crack system about 50 feet to the right of Lunch Route.
