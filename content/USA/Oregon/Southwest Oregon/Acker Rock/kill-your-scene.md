# Description
Left side crack and the taller of the two Leprechaun Buttress cracks. A dicey start is protected with a bolt. Once in the crack it leads up perfect hand jams to a wild lie-back off-width roof. Shares top anchors with Strung-Out. PG = leads and exposure may not be suitable for someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.

# Location
Flying Leprechaun Buttress.Â Hike over and around the north ridge of Acker Rock where you will find a large square block of high quality rock.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007, map page 43.

# Protection
trad gear to 4 inches, rappel bolts.
