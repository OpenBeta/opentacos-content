# Description
In the Sun Bowl, this Sunrise climbs the right strip of patina. It is also the bolt line just left of Sinister Footwear. Rappel from chains located at the top of the patina. PG = leads and exposure may not be suitable for someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating. Route can seem a little dirty. The top anchors to the Sunrise Tower patina are easily accessed by way of 'Weenie with a Tan' (5.7).
