# Description
Make two 100-foot rappels (possibly three) down the cirque between Eagle's Dare Pinnacle and the greater Acker Rock. At the obvious break in slope where you find yourself looking out over the abyss with 300 feet more to go consider returning following the bolt line back the way you just rappelled. Route may be a bit dirty in places.

# Location
Mid-rappel into the base of Eagle's Dare.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007, topo G page 61.

# Protection
bolts and chains
