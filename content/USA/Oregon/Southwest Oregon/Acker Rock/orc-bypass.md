# Description
Fun little adventure romp, the Orc Bypass begins in the gully uphill (right) of the dry waterfall and Observation Rock. Using the off-width chimney, chimney up to the first large ledge (right side). A bolt protects the move from the chimney to the ledge (Orc Ledge). Once on the ledge follow it to the outside corner of Observation Point. Setting up a belay on the corner will be needed to reduce rope drag when you continue around the corner. From the corner follow the Orc Ledge around the corner traversing across Observation Point until you reach the middle belay anchors for Poodle Bite. Make a 150 foot rappel back to the base of Observation Point or summit on the 2ndÂ  pitch of Poodle Bite (5.10b).
