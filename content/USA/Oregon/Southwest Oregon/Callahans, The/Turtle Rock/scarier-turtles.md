# Description
A variation of Scary Turtles. Before the final crux sequence of Scary Turtles follow the alternative bolt line that traverses to the right out into the overhang and maneuver the final wildly exposed moves to separate top anchors out on the "Turtles Head". A great view of the valley floor almost 2,000 feet below. Rappel of chains or walk-off. Lower half of the route is in the shade and requires annual maintenance.
