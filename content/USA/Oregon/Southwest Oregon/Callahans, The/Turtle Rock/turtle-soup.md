# Description
While this is a very short route relative to the area, it is a very fun climb with lots of variety. There is a short (about 15 ft) easy scramble to the top of Turtle Ridge from the far left saddle that makes nearly all the routes on Turtle easily accessible for topropes.

Turtle Soup begins at 5.7 with a very fun 5.9 crux problem about six feet from the ridge top.

The route remains in the winter shade of trees and requires annual maintenance. That said it makes for an excellent toprope route for beginners or anyone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing.

# Location
far left side of Trutle Rock.

# Protection
bolts, chains
