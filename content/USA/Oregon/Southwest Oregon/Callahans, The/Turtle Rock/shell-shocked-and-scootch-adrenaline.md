# Description
Pitch-1 (70 feet, 5.13a): Begins up the south arete from the end of the cat-walk with a combination of horizontal roof pulls and a classic arete offering great exposure overlooking the Flournoy Valley almost 2,000 feet below. The first pitch ending at the belay anchors on top the first pitch or Head Out requires an explosive roof-pull followed by difficult arete moves that make this route so challenging.

Caution!! If you choose to rappel off this set of chains pay attention as you are no longer directly over the cat-walk where you started from.

Pitch-2 (55 feet, 5.11c): Traverse hard right onto the south arete, following the arete to the top of the "Turtle's Head". This pitch begins with fun easier arete and pocket moves but soon becomes more serious as it moves through overhung and airy crux moves (5.11c). Cruxes maybe height dependent.

Walk-off.

Caution!! If you choose to rappel off this set of chains pay attention as you are no longer directly over the cat-walk where you started from. One person has already rappelled off their rope here.
