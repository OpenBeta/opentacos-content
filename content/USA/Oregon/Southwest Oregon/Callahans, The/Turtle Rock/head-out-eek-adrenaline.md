# Description
Pitch-1: Begins on the cat-walk to the right of the Cracked Turtle crack. First move off the ground is height dependent, otherwise requiring a dyno. Traverses right into the crux (5.11a) moves just after a bulge pullover. Next move out over an airy drop-off onto an easier steep face with friction moves leading to belay anchors.

Caution!! If you choose to rappel off this set of chains pay attention as you are no longer directly over the cat-walk where you started from.

Pitch-2: follow boltline straight up off the belay as the route become more serious it splits with 5.11c variation (Terturum) to the left and 5.11a (Eek) to the right. Follow the bolt line that veers right back onto the arete tying in with the upper half of Scootch Adrenaline to follow the arete to the top of the "Turtles Head". Walk-off.

Caution!! If you choose to rappel off this set of chains pay attention as you are no longer directly over the cat-walk where you started from. One person has already rappelled off their rope here.
