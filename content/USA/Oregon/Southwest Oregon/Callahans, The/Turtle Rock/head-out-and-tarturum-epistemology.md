# Description
Pitch-2 variation to Head Out (55 feet, 5.11c): From the top of Head Out climb straight up off the belay to an overhanging section where the route splits. Follow the left bolt line to a shallow dihedral and the top of the "Turtle's Head". Crux moves are near the finish in overhung, airy terrain. Walk-off.

Caution!! If you choose to rappel off this set of chains pay attention as you are no longer directly over the cat-walk where you started from. One person has already rappelled off their rope here.

# Location
Southwest end of Turtle Rock.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007. Map 2 & topo A pages 82-83.

# Protection
