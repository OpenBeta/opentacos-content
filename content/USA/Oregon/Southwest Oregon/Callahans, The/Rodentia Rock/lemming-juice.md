# Description
Begins at the downhill most SE corner of the Rodentia formation and is the first bolted line you see as you approach on the Baseline Trail from Turtle Rock.

The crux is right after the first bolt with a tricky move getting through the dihedral. Follow the bolt line veering right above an undercut lip. Rappel off summit chains.

# Location
Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon Vol. 2: Umpqua map page 66-65, maps 3a & 3b page 104-105, and GPS coordinates in UTM's page 109.

# Protection
