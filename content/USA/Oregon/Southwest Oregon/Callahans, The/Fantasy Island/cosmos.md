# Description
Start at the end of the narrow ridge and make some tricky .8 moves. Use the holds on the arete and take in the view of the Cascade foothills to the west.

# Location
Cosmos is the bolted line just off to the right of the exposed arete. Belay on "The Ramp". The belay might want to clip into the fixed anchors on this narrow sandstone ridge.

# Protection
Bolts
