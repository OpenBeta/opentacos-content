# Description
Very fun route but, because of its remote location relative to access this route has never received enough use to stay clean for long.

Follow bolts up then right and around lower quality overhang to tie in with Outer Limits. Finish at ramp below Cosmos Wall or finish on Outer Limits (5.8). Because of its N aspect and tress shaddowing this route requires a fair amount of cleaning at the beginning of each season.

# Location
Far right side of lower East Wall below Outer Limits.

# Protection
bolts, walk-off onto Cosmos Ramp or Rappel from chains above Cosmos Wall.
