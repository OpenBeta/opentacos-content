# Description
Follow the left trending crack, just left of the "{hourglass") about 70 feet to the prominent belay ledge ("Southwest Ledge") above. Two bolts protect the bottom half of the climb.Â  Once you're over the lip (5.9), the last half is quality crack climbing (5.10a).

# Location
In the guide pp 144 this is identified to be on the east wall of Fantasy Island but is actually South facing. There is a ledge trail that will take you from the North saddle around the right side (looking down hill) to the downhill south side of the rock. Or, scramble to and rappel from the "Southwest Ledge".

# Protection
bolts, 0.5 to 3-inch cams
