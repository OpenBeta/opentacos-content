# Description
Follows the arete up left side (looking up) of Fear and Worry Wall.

Top anchors are easily accessible from a little used scramble trail that runs from the upper saddle of Mind Planet to the top this formation.

This fun arete has a variety of moves using pockets, edges, and friction with balancy crux (5.11a) moves halfway up the arete.

Route requires annual maintenance at the beginning of each season.
