# Description
Begins at the far right corner of of the Citadel Wall. There are two ways to begin this route.

Pitch 1: Begin by either climbing direct straight up 20 feet to the 2nd bolt (5.10b), or begin on the far corner slab climbing left 30 ft on the friction slab (5.9+). Continue following bolts up the slab to the belay anchors (5.7).

Pitch 2: from the belay climb right, then strait up following bolts for about 40 feet (5.8) until they begin angling left towards the arete on top a large roof. Follow bolts left through ledges (5.8) until the route merges with White Raven's Peril and moves onto the arete (5.7). Follow the arete to the summit (5.6). Make sure to take in the views while on the arete!

Walk-off. Follow the ridge up hill until you find remnants of an undeveloped scramble trail that winds down 20 feet and then out to the left then down the left (looking downhill side of Sunspear Pinnacle.
