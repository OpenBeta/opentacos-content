# Description
P1: climb the bolted off-width chimney crack (very fun 5.8) about 30 feet following bolts onto slab to belay anchors (- 5.10a ). This pitch in itself is worth the hike.

P2: follow bolts right off the belay. Once you've made your second clip make the crux move (5.10d) up onto a slightly lower angle slab. Note: in a pinch the bolt can be used to aid through this move. Follow bolts up onto the headwall and out the right side under the overhang (- 5.10a). Continue following bolts left onto the arete above the overhang (5.6). Once on the arete take time to look out over the valley below! It doesn't get any better than this. Continue up the arete to the summit belay (no chains).

Walk-off. Follow the ridge up hill until you find remnants of an undeveloped scramble trail that winds down 20 feet and then out to the left then down the left (looking downhill side of Sunspear Pinnacle.

# Location
