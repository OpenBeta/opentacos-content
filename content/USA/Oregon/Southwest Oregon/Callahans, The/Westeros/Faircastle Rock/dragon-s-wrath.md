# Description
P1: climb the bottom headwall that is protected with a single bolt (about 8 feet, 5.8) to a wide left sloping dirty off-width crack. Follow the crack to its end placing gear to 5 inches (5.7). Once on top the crack scramble right around the base of a headwall to a large bolted belay.ledge.

P2: While the first pitch of Dragon's Wrath is one * at best, the second pitch makes up for what the fist is lacking. From the large belay ledge follow the bolt to the summit. The crux and most fun portion of the climb is climbing through the small huecos (5.10b) near the top. And the view. The second pitch is bolted for sport and I believe we have chains on top, but don't count on it.

# Location
This route begins on the upper west corner of Faircastle Rock. It is a bit of a scramble up about 10 feet to the bottom of the route.

# Protection
cams to 5 inches, bolts
