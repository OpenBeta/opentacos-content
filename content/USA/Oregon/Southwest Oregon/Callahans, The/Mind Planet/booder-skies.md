# Description
There is easy-low exposure access and walk-off to and from top anchors.

Shares top anchors with Climb the Clouds.

Staying with the bolt line to the right of 'Clouds' make for fun thin friction climbing.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon 2007 Vol. 2: Umpqua Map 1 page 80, and Topo H page 98.

# Location
Located in the "Beginning area" on the backside (east) of Mind Planet. this climb is short but steep enough to keep a beginners weight balanced over their feet. The area is also surrounded by trees and rock with little exposure until the climber is on top Mind Planet where you will have fantastic views over looking the Flournoy Valley and Cascades.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon 2007 Vol. 2: Umpqua Map 1 page 80, and Topo H page 98.

# Protection
