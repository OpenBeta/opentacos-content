# Description
Requires annual maintenance to keep clean.

Pitch 1 (50ft., 5.6-5.9): any bolted path you want to Duck Pond anchors.

Pitch 2 (80ft., 5.10d): from the top of Duck Pond veer left and follow the dirty water-crack through some tenuous dihedral crux moves before following bolts onto the slab to left where multiple 5.8-5.10+ moves lead to a second crux of tricky friction at the finish.

Walk-off.

Caution: Rappelling off Mind Planet is >100 feet.
