# Description
Route begins at belay anchors off on the far right side (looking up) of Far SIde Wall (SW Mind Planet) at the corner of the hu-normous overhanging roof and ascends overhangs and bulges (5.10c) before heading into easier climbing to the next set of belay anchors. Second pitch continues up easier Tyee sandstone slab-friction and then mantles over an overhanging bulge (5.11a) onto a friction ramp before summitting. Top anchors are easily accessed but top roping requires the use of several directional.

Route is in full sun with great airy exposure over looking the valley below. Requires little annual maintenance.
