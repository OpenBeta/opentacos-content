Located in the "Beginning area" on the backside (east) of Mind Planet. this climb is short but steep enough to keep a beginners weight balanced over their feet. The area is also surrounded by trees and rock with little exposure until the climber is on top Mind Planet where you will have fantastic views over looking the Flournoy Valley and Cascades.
