# Description
Fun closely bolted route that begins on low angled Tyee angled slab-friction and progressively becomes steeper. Great beginners route as long as you encourage them to see how far up the beginning low angled slab as they can without using their hands. Otherwise their balance will be through off their feet making the slab more difficult. For this reason we tend to start a beginner Duck Pond which is steeper before moving onto Indispensable. Both top anchors are easily accessed from the sides for toproping. This route can make for a fun first lead especially for anyone transitioning from the gym to outdoors.

Note: Both pitches arch to the left (looking up). Top roping requires the use of directionals and special care is required if rappelled.
