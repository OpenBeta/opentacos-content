# Description
Description is for the second pitch, which starts at the end of Denial Ledge. Begins with thin, but positive crimps in the overhang. Good holds disappear until right at the crux, where a powerful move off of smears gets you to a "Thank God" bucket.

# Location
First pitch (.11b) starts at the base of Mind Planet from alongside the Baseline Trail. Second pitch is described above and there is a bolted belay station at the end of Denial Ledge. Third pitch (.11b) ends atop the formation.

# Protection
Bolts
