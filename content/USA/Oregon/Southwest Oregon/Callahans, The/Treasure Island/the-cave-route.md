# Description
The cave route begins at the downhill side of the rock. Follow the bolt line to the ledge and bolted belay about 20 feet up. From this belay you can climb to the left side arete route (Pot of Gold .10d), right (Midas .8), or continue straight up (Cave Route). Beginning the climbs at this belay will help reduce rope drag later on. Rappelling back down to this ledge and then to the ground in 2 separate raps will help avoid rope entanglement in the bushes.

P1: climb to the lower left of the fist cave (5.7) and follow bolts out onto the left slab and up (5.10a slab friction) into a large cave above (5.9). Once inside the cave set up a belay from chains or continue the remaining 25 feet to the summit. The cave is a great place to hangout and take in the view of the valley below, but so is the top.

P2: follow bolts out the left side of the cave (5.8) and up to the summit (5.7).

Rappel: 100 ft. from chains.

Note: you are likely to encounter some poison oak on the bottom portion of this route.

# Location
Hike the Baseline Trail past Trolls Throne and School House rocks to Invisabolt. At Invisabolt the trail drops down with a switchback and continues on. Treasure Island will be the next large pinnacle sitting by itself after the switchback (about 200 feet).

# Protection
bolts and chains
