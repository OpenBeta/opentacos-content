# Description
From the downhill side of Arrow Rock scramble a gully 30 feet to reach a chimney. Climb the chimney to and overhang. Once past the overhang climb a dihedral to some modrone trees. Continue up or belay from the trees to reduce drag. From the madrones, scramble the rest of the way to the large ledge that contours from the left where you will find a bolted belay. Walk-off following the ledge to the left (SW) or belay the next pitch and continue to the summit on 'Upper Arrow Rock' (5.10a).

Fun route but needs maintenance.

# Location
Hike the Westeros Trail to the base of Griffin's Roost where you will find a ridge route with no trail to the top of Casterly Rock with anchors on top.

# Protection
Gear and bolts.
