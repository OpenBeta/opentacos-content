# Description
This will most likely be the first route you'll be able to locate at the Lost World. The route climbs the most direct line up a rounded low-angled arete that comes to the base of the rock. The crux of Walk the Line will be making it up the first 15 feet.

Lost world is in the tree shadows so will require brushing at the beginning of each season.

Top anchors are easily accessed by scrambling up the north side of Lost World.
