# Description
Standing under the large roof look left and find a single bolt of a short headwall. From this bolt climb the headwall (5.10a) traversing left onto a large ledge/walk-way. Walk the ledge left 10 to 15 almost to a large maple tree where you will find a set of belay bolts. Setting up the next belay here will save from rope-drag on the next long pitch. Ascend the steep gully (5.6) to the steep buttress above. Once you've reached the last visible bolt at the foot of the steep buttress, climb left around the arete corner on thin friction (5.10b) and up the left side of the buttress to its flat top. One on the flat top follow class-4 stairs to the next headwall. Ascend the short headwall (5.8) and scramble to the top of the rock (5.6). Walk-off the north side or rappel off the top anchors for Morpheous.
