# Description
A consistently challenging but well protected climb up Inca's north face. Because of its north aspect Hangman is one of the last to dry in the spring and requires an annual spring brushing. Now that it sits out of the trees, once cleaned it should remain so.

# Location
Inca's north wall. Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007. Map on page 66, photos pages 152, 156, and Map 12 page 157.

# Protection
Fixe SS 3/8 double expansion, no chains
