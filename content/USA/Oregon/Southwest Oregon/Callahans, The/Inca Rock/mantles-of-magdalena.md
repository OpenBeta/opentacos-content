# Description
Crux is within the first 25 feet of this climb. It includes two thin challenging (5.9) mantel moves route joins with Gallows of San Palo ending at two bolts before summit head wall. Rappel back down (no chains) or summit by way of Hangman (5.10a/b or 5.9 A1).

Route requires some brushing at the beginning of each season. However Inca and Orphan Rocks are now in an open clearcut so once cleaned routes should remain clean.
