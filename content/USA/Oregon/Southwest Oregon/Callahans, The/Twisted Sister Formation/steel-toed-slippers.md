# Description
This route begins with a dirty scramble and slog at the bottom to get onto the better slab in the north saddle between Twisted Sister and a smaller pinnacle to the north (Little Sister). From the saddle scramble 5.5 slab friction to the summit of Little Sister. Other than the fact that Chandler climbed this in his steeled toed boot the route probably doesn't deserve to be mentioned.
