# Description
This is a fun route that would deserve more stars except the lower section becomes mossy each winter and has not received a good cleaning in awhile.

Pitch 1: quality friction follow bolts left to dogleg around slightly overhanging wall (5.10a). Above the slight overhang there is easier climbing to the headwall (5.9). Ascend the headwall (5.6) to a set of belay anchors (two bolts, no chains).

Pitch 2: follow bolts up easier climbing to summit (5.7).

Rappel off two bolts, no chains.

# Location
Cellular-owl and Invisabolt will be the first two and only routes visible from the Baseline Trail after passing Schoolhouse rocks. Cellular-owl will be the bolted line about 20 feet uphill of Invisabolt.

# Protection
Fixe SS 3/8 double expansion, no chains
