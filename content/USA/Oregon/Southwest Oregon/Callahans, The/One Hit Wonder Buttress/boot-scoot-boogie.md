# Description
A flaring off-width crack to the right of Bust A Move. Scrambling 15 feet to a ledge at the bottom of Bust A Move to access the Boot Scoot crack. Begins with a true 4" off-width and continues with a continuous lie-back to a mantle where it joins back up to finish on the upper portion of Bust A Move. Tricky placements and really fun climbing.

Can be toproped with a 4th class scramble from the south side to the ledge above.

Rappel or walk-off to the south.
