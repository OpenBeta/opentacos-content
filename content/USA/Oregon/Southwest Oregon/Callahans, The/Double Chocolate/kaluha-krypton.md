# Description
Kahlua Krypton is short but consistent 5.10a- climb up the center of the headwall from Lizard's Ledge. Route begins at Lizard's Ledge where the winter sun always shines. The headwall above the ledge to the top is very slightly overhung and is one of the first place to dry during wet periods. The route does not collect moss so it stays clean and relatively closely bolted so it is a good choice for anyone transitioning from gym to outdoor lead climbing. It is also easily top roped by way of the Gold Finger (5.5) one move access route.
