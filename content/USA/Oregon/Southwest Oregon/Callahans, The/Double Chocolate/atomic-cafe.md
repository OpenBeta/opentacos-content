# Description
Climbs from the ground onto the summit of Double Chocolate.

First 30 feet climbs 5.6-.7. After 30 feet or so becomes 5.7 with lots of holds ending with a 5.10a crux using thin ledges over slight overhang near the top, then topping out on thin 5.7 slab.

A climb with fun change ups, but because of its location on the NE corner will require light brushing at the beginning of each season.

This route is easily toproped by way of Gold Finger (5.5).
