# Description
Starts on on the ground below Lizards Ledge following the bolt line just right of Strawberry Jam crack. This is a fun route to lead when clean, but requires a light brushing at the beginning of each season. This route is easily toproped from Lizard's Ledge.

When clean, a good lead route for anyone transitioning from the gym to outdoor climbing.
