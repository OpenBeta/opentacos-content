# Description
Climbs for right corner arete off Lizard's Ledge from right of the lower small hueco up the left side off-width of the protruding flake. Chains on top.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon volume 2: Umpqua 2007. Topo L and Map 4 pp. 107-108.

# Location
Far right side of Lizard's Ledge on Double Chocolate.

This route gets full sun and remains clean. It is one of the first to dry.

Bolts are relatively close and it is easily toproped by way of Gold Finger (5.5). It can feel a bit airy but is still a good choice for anyone transitioning from gym to outdoor leads.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon volume 2: Umpqua 2007. Maps 1, 3a, 3b, and 4 pp. 80-108.

# Protection
bolts and chains
