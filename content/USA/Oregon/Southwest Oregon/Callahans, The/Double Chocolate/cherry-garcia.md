# Description
Begins on the access ramp to Lizard's Ledge just before the first break in the ramp.

Climbs to the right of the larger center huecos, topping out at the top anchors for Sunday Morning Obsession.

Because of the shaddows and huecos this route requires some brushing at the begging of each season.
