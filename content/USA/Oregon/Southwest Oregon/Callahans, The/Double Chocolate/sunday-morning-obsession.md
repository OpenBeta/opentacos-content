# Description
From the far left corner of Lizard's Ledge follow bolts up the SW corner arete making a series of challenging off-balance moves.

This route is now in the shade so can collect moss and will require some TLC at the beginning of each season before leading.

Bolting is relatively close and the surrounding trees reduce exposure. Once brushed this is a good choice for anyone transitioning from gym to outdoor leads. Using a directional it is easily toproped bay way of Gold Finger (5.5).
