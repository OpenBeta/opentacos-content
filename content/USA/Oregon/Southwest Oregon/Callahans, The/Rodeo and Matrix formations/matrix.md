# Description
Climb the first 5 bolts (5.9) to the steep short 10-foot high headwall at the top of the formation. Aid the 1/2 inch drilled holes through the headwall. Very fun lead when the rock is clean. However, the rock lies in the tree shadows so expect some maintenance will be needed until it too becomes part of the ever expanding clearcut.

Top anchors (no chains) are easily accessible.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon Vol. 2: Umpqua map 9 134, topo W page 133.
