# Description
Fun route with a lots of variety and exposure but will require some TLC to remove moss that has accumulated since it was last climbed. This will be an exceptional route once it is sucked into the ever expanding clearcut and receives more sun.

From the Baseline Trail climb up about 30 feet (5.10a) to just under the large overhanging roof (alternative start is just right of the direct start, 5.7). Traverse 15 feet left along the base of the roof to a set of belay anchors (5.8) just right of the arete.

P2: Step left from the arete about 15 feet (5.9) and right, into a small cave. Clip he bolt on the upper left lip of the cave then move to the right side where you will find another bolt (5.7). Pull out of the cave on the right side and then climb left to the next set of belay anchors (5.8).

P3: Climb up and left to a large shallow cave (5.10a). From the cave ascend up and right on classic thin Tyee sandstone friction-slab to the summit (5.10a).

Rappel down backside, no chains.
