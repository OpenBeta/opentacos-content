# Description
As you walk out onto the northern most of the two buttresses you will come to madrone (stump?) and bolt anchor used for setting up a rappel and toprope.

Caution: 70 feet is a wild guess for the height.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua Map page 66-65, Topo Ah page 162.

# Location
North side of the first buttress you come to as you walk the ridge south from Brittsan Rock.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua Map page 66-65.

# Protection
One bolt and presumably a stump.
