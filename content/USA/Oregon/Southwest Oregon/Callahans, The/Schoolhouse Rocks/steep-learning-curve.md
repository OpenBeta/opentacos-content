# Description
Refer to Umpqua Guide topo S, pp. 122.

Start in the trees at downhill base of the east Schoolhouse formation. Begins on ledges and pockets to a bulge at third bolt using undercut feet and poor holds. Above this easier climbing leads to crux (5.11a) at fifth bolt with a series of delicate and strenuous moves, followed by a scramble to the top. Crux can be avoided by making with a run-out moving well right of the fifth bolt.

# Location
Refer to Umpqua Guide map 5, pp. 117. Route 5, right side of Schoolhouse Rocks.

# Protection
bolts, rappel chains or walk-off.
