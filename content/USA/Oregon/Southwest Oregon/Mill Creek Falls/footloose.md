# Description
Great problem, just make sure you bring a solid spotter and a crash pad. Start with a high left hand and a right on the crimp, traverse to the right and then top out. The crux is a stellar heel hook (I'll let you figure out the rest). Although the start is not very difficult, you can not quite get a crash pad below the climber until they make the first move. The pad sits on a rock directly below the climber forcing their feet to stay high the whole time. Easy walk off

# Location
From the parking lot hike to the boulders, go upstream about 40-50yds. The boulder is right next to a big tree near a small pool of water about 30-40yds away from the main flow of the creek. If you've made it to Faking Twosday you've just passed it.
