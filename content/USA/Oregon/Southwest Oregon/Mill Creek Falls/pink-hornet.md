# Description
Jump/hop start into a jug match, edgy foot work with a dash of smearing, solid leaning and a sketchy top out. Most difficult part is leaning without falling and effectively using your feet though it's still a V1

# Location
The route is near the river, while most go left at the headway to where the river breaks most go right down a rocky path to find a secluded little alcove, the rock is behind some foliage along the river's bank.

# Protection
Spot and a pad.
