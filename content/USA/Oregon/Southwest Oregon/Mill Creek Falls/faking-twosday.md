# Description
Two for one special! Easier/juggy top out straight up(V1), or a pocket traverse to the right (V1-2)

# Location
Go to the end of the Avenue of Boulders trail, and continue following the river upstream. There's a large cliff (full of great cracks by the way) with the words, "Faking Tuesday" tagged onto it (NOT by me!!). Looking away from the graffiti, towards the river will reveal several amazing boulders. If you get to the bridge you walked too far.
