# Description
From the parking/redneck party area, walk east/southeast ~75 ft and down the slope to the exposed sandstone slab. Start the climb with a ~45 m rappel to the bottom, either using two 60 m ropes or by rappelling to the intermediate belay station using a single rope, making sure to hang climbers left, and rappelling again to the bottom of the climb.

Climb starts with serious slab moving up through the bolts making sure to take advantage of the small concretions and narrow pockets created by erosion of mudstone rip-up clasts at the cruxes. Follow bolts up the slab moving left and up the small crack and out to the belay station. 8 bolts.

From the belay station, place a draw in the anchor and move right and up the slab section approaching the steep wall and crux. Clip the bolts at the wall and move up and through the crux making sure to avoid any loose crimps. Do some fancy footwork and move right and up the ramp and continue to the final crux immediately below the top anchors. Veer right and take advantage of any small concretions or tiny pockets while finishing on the slab. 6 bolts.

# Location
Walk ~75 ft from the parking area down to the top of the cliff looking for the exposed slab and anchors. Several large rocks work as large steps. Caution: tree stump at bottom is starting to rot and the rock up against it that forms a nice standing spot is loose and going to go in the future.

# Protection
Quick draws.
