# Description
Lower down to the bottom belay station ledge using either one of the "notched" stumps, or by lowing down the grassy steep slope using the single bolt and then down to the lower rap rings and then swinging left while lowering.

From the bottom, follow the bolts up and left staying in the corner and using the deep crack for solid fingers (5.7). Continue up through the narrowing corner eventually slowing down with a careful mantle onto slabby face climbing. Finish on the face using careful footwork before reaching the anchor station.

# Location
Route is on south wall. From the parking spot, walk to the south down the slope and slightly east. Look for stumps with notches in them for a direct rappel, or can use single bolt to lower down to rap rings and then swing left while rappelling from rings.

# Protection
10 bolts
