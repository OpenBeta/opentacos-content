# Description
Project of unknown difficulty.  Begins at the bottom of a large overhanging roof on the south end of the upper tier of rocks.  From the ground behind an ancient oregon grape bush, start up an offwidth, then turn to diagonal finger crack which gains the boulders under the roof.  From there pivot left and cross the overhanging wall to access the clean, hard arete to the top slab.  There is a top boulder above that can be bypassed on left or right.

# Location
From the Bear Ridge parking, an upper tier of rock is hidden in the large trees on the hill above.  Easy top approach through the back of the gravel pit up a short grassy hill.

# Protection
Will need  some bolts.
