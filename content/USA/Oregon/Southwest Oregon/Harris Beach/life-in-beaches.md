# Description
The problem is an over hung juggy climb. Its currently a standing start but I'm sure a variation of a sit start could be added that would greatly increase the challenge.

The Crux is the second to last move. It's not physically difficult, it's just a long right throw to a hidden jug when your about 10 feet off the ground. Fun stuff, try it if you're in the area.Â  Currently you just drop from the top, but I'm sure you could top out for some extra spice.

# Location
Down and around the main "crag"

When walking from the north end down you should see the front of the boulder with unique rock formations. Follow the trail on the mountain side, (as opposed to Oceanside) around the boulder. After the trail loops nearly all the way around the boulder you should see some obvious jugs.

# Protection
Clean landing area
