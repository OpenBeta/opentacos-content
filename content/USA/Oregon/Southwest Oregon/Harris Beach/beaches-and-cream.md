# Description
The problem starts on a flake on the left. Climb toward the right and top out. To get down,  walk to where the trail gets close to the boulder,  down climb.  Perhaps have a friend bring a crash pad around.

Be wary of the top, there are many loose rocks, but the climb is solid below it.  I'll clean the top up next time I go back.

# Location
Far right, near the trail, looking south. Far right, near the beach looking north. The trail passes right by it.
