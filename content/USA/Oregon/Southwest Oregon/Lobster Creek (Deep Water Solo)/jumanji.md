# Description
Traverse your way to the start and you will find a super good, huge jug where you can have both feet on prior to the vertical start. Â From there, it goes straight up and a bit to the left, finish with an odd top out.

3 stars because it's DWS it the middle of Oregon!

# Location
If you GPS "Lobster Creek Campground," it will put you right by the bridge. Go to Lobster Creek Bridge and the rock is located on the north end of the bridge and there is a little trail that goes down the side of the bridge to the rock.

# Protection
The water is the protection but having a friend watching is nice (current may be strong).
