# Description
A sloping wall with a wide variety of hand and foot holds. The removal of loose blocks has exposed rock previously hidden away, making it appear more orange than the rest of the wall. Arguably the easiest route at Emigrant Lake.

# Location
This route shares a belay station with

Mr. Anderson,

but goes to the right instead of straight up. The belay station is just before the trail along the crag becomes a steep scramble to the chimney at the left end of the wall.

# Protection
Protected by 4 bolts. Anchor consists of 2 bolts
