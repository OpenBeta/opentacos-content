# Description
Great holds at the start create interesting moves to the first bolt. Easy climbing from there until you reach the fourth bolt, where the face creates an exciting finish. The 10a rating is for the direct finish on the face (no stepping off to the left ledge).

# Location
Route begins in the main belay platform at the right side of the Poison Oak Wall where the approach trail reaches the wall. It is located in the middle of the face at the open area. A sharp boulder makes the start a little easier.

# Protection
Protected by 5 bolts. Anchor consists of 2 bolts with rap rings
