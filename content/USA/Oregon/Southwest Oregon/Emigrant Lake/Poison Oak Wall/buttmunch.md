# Description
Route follows a set of cracks up a slightly overhung wall on the left side of the gully. The route eases up before the anchor, but make sure to avoid loose rocks on the ground there. You can access the anchor for Top Roping by taking the scramble at the end of the gully, and walking to the rocks above the left side of the gully.

If you fall while climbing, beware of swinging into the wall behind you

# Location
Walk all the way to the left side of the poison oak wall into the cave/gully area. The climb begins on the left side with the obvious crack. A bit further on the right is a small scramble to the top where you can access the anchors.

# Protection
Bolted anchors with chains
