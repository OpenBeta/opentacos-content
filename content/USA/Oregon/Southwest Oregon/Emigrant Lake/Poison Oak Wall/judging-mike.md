# Description
Steep start leads to an easy climb. This route joins

Cornholio

at the fourth bolt, where it finishes on the same 10a direct face (no stepping off to the left ledge).

# Location
Located just to the right of

Cornholio,

around the end of the belay platform. It is best to belay from the same spot as

Cornholio

due to the narrow and sloped start of the route.

# Protection
Protected by 6 bolts. Anchor consists of 2 bolts with rap rings
