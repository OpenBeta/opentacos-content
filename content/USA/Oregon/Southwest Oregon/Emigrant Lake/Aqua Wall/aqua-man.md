# Description
A steep face at the base of the route holds the crux, but the route eases up afterwards. It is a nice lead for climbers that find the routes of the Poison Oak Wall easy, but are unable to do the routes of the Aqua Cave.

A bit over halfways up, there is a large bulge. If you go left, the route is 10b. If you go right, the route is 5.11. See topo for clarification.

# Location
Furthest right bolt line on the Aqua Wall. The first bolt is a ways up, but the climbing to it is easy.

# Protection
Protected by 7 bolts. Anchor with chains
