# Description
Difficult moves through the first 20 feet or so, and then easier climbing to an anchor. The bolt lines are really compact in this area, so make sure to stick to the right one!

# Location
Begins just right of the Aqua Cave. The route follows some cracks just beyond the lip of the cave

# Protection
Protected by 4 bolts. Anchor with chains
