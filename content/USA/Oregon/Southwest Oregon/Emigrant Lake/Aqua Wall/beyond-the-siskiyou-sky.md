# Description
The route begins with a nicely bolted ramp, and then opens up into more vertical climbing that is made easier by the large block edges of the wall. The route ends with a nice roof before the anchor. A gear placement is needed to protect the final moves.

# Location
Just before the Aqua Cave, there is a slab that runs towards the top of the cave. There are two bolts protecting the opening moves.

# Protection
Protected by 7 bolts, gear placements at the end. Chains for anchor
