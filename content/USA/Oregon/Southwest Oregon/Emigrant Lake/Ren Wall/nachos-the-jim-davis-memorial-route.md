# Description
Interesting climb that leads into a small cave, runs up the cave, and then along a nice ridge at the top of the cave. Inside the cave area, a large variety of bird droppings and owl pellets (with lots of bones!) can be seen blanketing the rock.

NOTE- Please be considerate of nesting birds on this route, especially in the spring

# Location
Shares a belay station with Burritos on top of a boulder located just above the high water line. This can be accessed by following the main trail from the parking area until it reaches the area where the crag meets the high water line.

# Protection
Protected by 3 bolts, anchor with singular chain
