# Description
One of the few climbs of Emigrant that goes directly up a face with few features, even though it is short. The route ends near the base of the Poison Oak Wall, which means that the top is easily accessible for top roping.

# Location
Begins about 25 feet up from the high waterline on the crag. A small spur trail breaks off and leads to a mildly overgrown belay station. To access the top, scramble over from the base of the Poison Oak Wall to the shiny chains.

# Protection
Protected by 3 bolts, has anchor with chains
