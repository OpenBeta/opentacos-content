# Description
Climbing begins on an easy ramp with sparse Poison Oak. At the end of the ramp, a large bulge creates the crux, with 5.10d to the right, or a 5.9 to the left. After the bulge, head for the large roof that contains surprisingly positive jugs. Please be considerate of nesting birds

# Location
Climb begins just above the high water line, easily accessible from the main trail. The climbs ends just to the right of a large white streak near the top of the wall.

# Protection
Protected by 6 bolts, anchor with chains
