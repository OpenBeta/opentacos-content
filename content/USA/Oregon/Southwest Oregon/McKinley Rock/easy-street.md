# Description
P1 - Same start as "Wipeout" to left of large Douglas fir, traverses mossy ledge right ( 5.6, ~ 80ft ) to corner belay. For a cleaner first pitch to Easy Street climb Wilding 101 (5.10a-).

P2 - follow along right side of rock seam until route moves left onto slab following bolt line to belay (5.6, ~140 ft) or follow new Wilding 101 bolt line up slab ending at same belay (5.8). P3 - Follow bolt line straight up and right up slab into a chute in the seam (5.7). Follow the chute to a Â small headwall where you will start right and move to the left and over (5.8) and onto a low angled slab and belay (right) below a tall headwall (150 ft). P4 - scramble and bush wack around the right side of the headwall following a dirty chute back left to a large ledge and bolted belay on top the head wall (class 5.0, 2 bolts, ~50 ft). P5 - (5.3, 150 ft, 1 bolt) scramble low angle slab up a chute left of the belay to a short headwall near the summit with a single bolt on right side of the headwall. Follow the summit ridge to the summit's highest point where you will find a register and rappel chains taking you down the south face (Four 95 foot rappels, third set of anchors will be a bit right while facing the rock).
