# Description
An easy route to locate and one I would recommend to anyone approaching McKinley Rock for the first time.

Shown on topo as "Easy Street Direct".

This is the last bolted line you will come to as you walk the trail along the bottom to the right corner of McKinley Rock.

Begins uphill from the large Douglas fir at the base of "Wipeout".

P1 - follow bolt line to a belay at the corner of the rock (~60 ft, 5.10a).

P2 - Follow the bolt line from Â the corner onto the slab to the belay above (~180 ft, 5.9).

P3 - Follows the line for "Easy Street" straight up and slightly right into the chute to a short headwall (5.8) from ontop the short headwall navigate the low angled slab left to belay anchors for "Wipeout" at the foot of the large headwall.

P4 - Follow the short bolt line up and over the large head wall (5.10a) instead of scrambling around its right side (class IV).

P5 - (5.0, 140 feet) Scramble up the low angled chute and onto the summit ridge (stay right) where you will find a bolt on the summit headwall. Scramble the summit ridge to the summit's highest point where you will find the register and rappel anchors (four 95 ft rappels down the south face from rap chains.).

# Location
Locate the large Douglas fir at the Base of "Wipeout" and "Easy Street". Continue on trail uphill approximately 50 feet or less.

# Protection
