# Description
first pitch climbs through a slightly over hanging water crack (5.10a) once above water crack climb lower angle slab (left, 5.9) or steeper thin slab (straight, 5.10c) to shared belay ledge. 3rd pitch follows bolt line through thin slab (5.10c) into depression above (5.10b) to summit. Once on summit follow ridge top right to register and rappel. Pitches can run 50m so a second rope is recommended.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007 map pages 204-205.

bolts, approx. 10 ft spacing., belays don't have chains yet, rappel chains at summit.

PG = exposure and leads generally may be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.
