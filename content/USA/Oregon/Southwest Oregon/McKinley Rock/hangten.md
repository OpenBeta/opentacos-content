# Description
Pitch 1: 150 feet - first 30 ft is in tree shadow, so a little mossy. It has never been cleaned so still the original fun start. once out of the shadows the rock is exceptionally coarse grained shallow intrusive andecite making for quality .10a slab climbing. Pitch 2: Well bolted Crux is at the headwall which we used to rate 5.10a now with some key holds missing seemed more .10b traversing low at the bolts, .10c traversing level with the bolts. Would love second opinion. Pitch 3: third pitch is fun slab 5.9, veers to left following anchors, disregard single bolt without hanger as this was abandoned while making first ascent.

# Location
Begins at lowest point in trail just before it starts back uphill towards Wipeout and EasyStreet.

# Protection
bolts, no chains at belays, rappel chains at summit.

PG = exposure and leads generally may be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.
