# Description
Terminator provides for a great finish to the day's climbing. This route is consistently thin steep slab. About 30 feet up it is bolted for a move right onto a mantle ledge. Taking this straight on is definitely a crux move, that I've only seen once with a heelhook.

Descent: bring 1" tubular webbing for rap off or upgrade top anchors with chains. Be sure to double check rope is on ground and not short.

Toprope: for easy access to top anchors walk around the corner to base of large Doug-fir and climb (Quantum Leap, 5.5 R) up and over the short ridge to top anchors of Terminator one or two bolts to ridge, one or two bolts on slab to Terminator.

# Location
Far left side of McKinley Rock you will find closely placed bolts heading up moderately steep slab to steep slab. The route is too the left of Half Moon Crack.

# Protection
3/8" Fixe SS double expansion bolts, no chains.
