# Description
As the trail approaches McKinely Rock (left side) you come to a distinctive left facing crescent shaped crack. Crux move is leaving the crack onto the steep slab (.10a). The route is bolted here to top anchors (no chains). From here you can continue to top by way of Indescent Exposure (.9 R) or Rap off.

# Location
First wall you will see from the trail, left side of McKinley Rock, and right of the obvious Terminator bolt line.

# Protection
Gear 1 to 4" finishing on 3/8 Fixe SS double expansion bolts. No chains at top anchors so bring chains to upgrade or 1" tubular webbing to rap off of.
