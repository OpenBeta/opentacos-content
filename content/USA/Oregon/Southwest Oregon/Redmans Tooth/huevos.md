# Description
P1 (80 ft): follow a thin crack about 40 feet to first bolt (5.8). Leave crack (5.10a) and follow a catwalk about 40 feet to belay anchors (5.7).

P2: (100 ft) Crux moves are climbing up 15 feet (.10c or A1) from left side of belay past 4 bolts into a thin crack. Once in the crack follow it clipping bolts and placing nuts to a small overhang traverse (.10d). Scramble further up the crack setting up next belay in the Doug-fir or continue up to first large ledge setting a belay in the crack. Note: rope drag may become an issue past the Doug-fir.

P3 (30 ft): From the ledge scramble up several large boulders to summit (unprotected 5.6).

Descent: replace slings and rappel off uphill side.

Find a shallow cave in the bottom downhill side. Huevos begins in a thin crack on the wall just right of the cave between the cave & a large Chinquapin.

# Protection
Small nuts and gear to 2 inches. Bolted rappel, no chains, bring extra webbing or chains.
