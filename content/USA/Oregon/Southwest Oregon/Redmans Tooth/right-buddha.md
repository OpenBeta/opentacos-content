# Description
Begins at the base of the Buddha's right side. Belay from the Douglas-fir at the base of the rock about 15 feet up slope of the road.

Climb the short wall to the right and then cross left just under a large bush about halfway up and unto onto the right Buddha where you will find a 3rd bolt on the face to the left of the bush. You may find an opportunity to place a piece as you cross over under the bush.

From the third bolt continue straight to the summit of the Right Buddha (aka right tower) following sparse bolting.

Rappel off, there are no rappel chains.
