# Description
Hike around the uphill side of the T-Rex formation and then drop down hill with Brontosaur Rock on your left. Head and Shoulders will be on the first up hill wall you come to on Brontosaur. 60 feet protected with two 1/4-inch bolts. Good rock, but this route would benefit from some upgrading.

# Location
Upper Brontosaur formation

# Protection
two steel 1/4-inch bolts placed in the '70s.
