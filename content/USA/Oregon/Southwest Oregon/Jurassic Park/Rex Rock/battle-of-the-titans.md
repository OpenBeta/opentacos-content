# Description
Pitch 1: Start at very bottom of rock in mossy section and mob up 160ft of bolts with one short crack of pro that uses one mid-large sized nut. Build an anchor using a few ~#1-3 cams at the top of the first summit. Belay anchors added 9/2020.

Pitch 2: Downclimb 5.6 crack, stepping across the abyss. Have fun climbing across the chimney, don't poop your pants.

Pitch 3: Climb last 60 ft to summit, last move is ~5.10a but safely protected with bolts. Would recommend bringing webbing for anchor, or another set of quick links as the rappel station causes lots of drag. Rappel chains added 9/2020.

60 meter reaches ground from summit but will have lots of drag. A second rope gets you farther uphill and reduces drag.

# Location
Only obvious route at base of rock.

# Protection
Bolted with nut placement on first pitch if nervous. Need cams to build the anchor at the top of the first summit.
