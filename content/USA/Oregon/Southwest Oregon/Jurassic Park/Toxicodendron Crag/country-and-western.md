# Description
This varied crack system will clean up nicely with traffic.

# Location
Begins climbers left of the prominent ToxicodendronTower, following left side of the yellow water streak before reaching the obvious crack system.  Finger, hand and forearm jams lead to a Doug Fir tree.  The crack gets wider, dirtier and easier behind the tree and finishes on top of the tower formation.  Easy 70m toprope from above off trees.

# Protection
Toprope.
