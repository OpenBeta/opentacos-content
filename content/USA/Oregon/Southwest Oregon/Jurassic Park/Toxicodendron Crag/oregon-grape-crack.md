# Description
Project.  Still some rock to remove.  The Oregon Grape crack is the prominent fist+ crack at the top of the formation.  There is an Oregon Grape bush growing out of the base of the crack.  The climb follows a beautiful orange crack at the base, angling right and up through a black water streak that is wet sometimes, then follows the arete to a platform where the Oregon Grape plant grows, follow the awkward fist+ crack for 20' to easy finish.  Variable rock quality but stellar positioning on a steep route.  I have no idea how hard it is but I started removing the loose rock and poison oak.

# Location
This is the most prominent line on the formation.

# Protection
Toprope from trees.  Project.
