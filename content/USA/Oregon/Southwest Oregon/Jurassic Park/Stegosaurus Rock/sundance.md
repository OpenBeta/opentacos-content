# Description
Adventure climb moving up progressively-steepening rock to a fun and exposed traverse.

Pitch 1: Long pitch moving up rock to large platform and belay station, 160 ft.

Pitch 2: Move across platform, downclimb to left and awkwardly traverse the exposed section to next belay station, 60 ft of 5.7 climbing.

Pitch 3: Head to summit, 50 ft of 5.9. Rappel on 60 m rope, probably should bring extra webbing to replace old stuff.

# Location
Big ass rock to left and uphill of parking area and approach trail.

# Protection
Lots of bolts. Bring webbing to leave at summit.
