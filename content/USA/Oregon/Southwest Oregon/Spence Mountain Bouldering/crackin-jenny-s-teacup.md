# Description
Huge ledge under the right arete gives a good foot stance.  Problem was originally climbed using the right hand arete, and a sharp side crimp as a left.  Bump to the sloping but good higher left hand position and either throw for the top or negotiate the variable intermediate holds.  Advancing the feet once the lip is gained provides a safe and savory mantle for the finish.

Variety of holds allows for fun dynamic moves or static sequencing.  Fun practice it all problem.

# Location
Walk left along the boulder from the approach trail, between the long face of the boulder and the tree. This problem lies on a wide/short flat face that faces the open lava flow.
