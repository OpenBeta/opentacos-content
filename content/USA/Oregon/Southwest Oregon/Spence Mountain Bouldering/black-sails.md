# Description
Using a thin left side pull and a wide right flake, compress and pull onto the face.  Feet on the good left low ledge.  Bump the crimps and finess the feet to pull up and left into a good pinch.  Blind holds on the left side of the arete give way to easier moves as you finish at the top of Nelson's arete.

May be a sit start variation to bump the grade a bit.

# Location
Climbs the right face of the boulder from the approach trail.  Sits between "Nelson's Arete" and "Hornigold's Handjob".
