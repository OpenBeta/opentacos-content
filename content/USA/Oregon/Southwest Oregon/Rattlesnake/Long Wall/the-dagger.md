# Description
Short and physical. Climbs the prominent rib feature. Start off the boulder and wrestle with the rib for a body-length. Then step right and stem/palm your way to the anchor with the help of a few pockets.

# Location
Close to where the Long wall meets the approach trail at the top of some sketchy steps. Furthest left bolt line in this little cluster of sport climbs.

# Protection
5 bolts. Rap hangers.
