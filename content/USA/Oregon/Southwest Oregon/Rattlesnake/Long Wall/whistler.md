# Description
Climbs the obvious black streak on the right side of the long wall. Starts with some liebacks then some long moves between big holds leading to a crux moving through a scoop at the last bolt. Fun movement on good rock.

# Location
Look for the black streak as you pass the Cloud Buttress. Hike to where the cliffline comes almost to the approach trail then back track along the cliff. Whistler starts behind a detached pillar.

# Protection
Bolts. Rap hangers.
