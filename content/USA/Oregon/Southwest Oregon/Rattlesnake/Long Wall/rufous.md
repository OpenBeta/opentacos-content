# Description
Fun steep liebacking through a bulge leads to thin pockets and edges going up a  less-than-vertical wall to the top of the cliff. The difficulty comes from the continuous nature of the upper wall. Your personal climbing preferences will determine whether you love or hate this one.

# Location
Second bolted climb outside the Cathedral.

# Protection
Bolts. Rap hangers. First bolt is high so stick clip might be nice though climbing is easy on the left, just slightly loose and sandy.
