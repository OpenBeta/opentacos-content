# Description
Straightforward climbing gets you close to the roof. Crux is pulling to and then over the roof. The rest of the route is a long, technical slab.

# Location
The last route on the Long Wall before the Cathedral. Can usually be identified by a fixed sling that hangs off the fourth bolt under the roof.

# Protection
Bolts. Chains on top.
