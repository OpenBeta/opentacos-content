# Description
A loose and somewhat awkward start leads to a solid and clean stemming corner. The crux is a blank section of the corner. After the corner, mantle onto a ledge and climb pockets and edges to the anchor.

# Location
On the Long Wall. Third bolt line right of the Cathedral. Look for the corner.

# Protection
Bolts, rap hangers.
