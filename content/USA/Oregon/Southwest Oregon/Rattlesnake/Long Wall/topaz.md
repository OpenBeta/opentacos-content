# Description
Bolted face in the middle of the Long Wall. Hardest individual moves are between the second and third bolt pulling on some shallow pockets. Then dog-leg left to a right-facing dihedral. For extra contrivance points, you can skip the obvious rest two bolts from the top. There is a variation that goes direct up the face to the anchor but the bolt hangers have been removed.

# Location
When looking at the cliff, Topaz is the fourth bolted line to the right of the Cathedral.

# Protection
9 bolts. Rap hangers
