# Description
One of two two-bolt micro climbs in the back of the cave (the left one). Fun, steep climbing on big holds. Add some value (in that contrived sport-climber way) by doing a sit start traverse in from the right. Watch out for bat/bird/critter poop near the top.

# Location
The leftmost of two climbs in the very back of the cave.

# Protection
Two bolts. This route shares chains with its conjoined twin: "Rain Sucks" (10a, slab/corner).
