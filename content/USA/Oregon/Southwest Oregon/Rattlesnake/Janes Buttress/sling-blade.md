# Description
Sweet arete climb above the Wedgie route.Start at the bottom of Janes chimney and climb Wedgie to the first set of anchors then continue on up the steep, awesome arete, using the arete edge , small crimps, and a couple cool big sloper pockets to another set of chain anchors just over the top. Ends with a cool mantle with great holds. One could also do a 4th class down climb from the top or rap off large pine tree.  Head for the big Madrone tree at the top of the chimney. Youll see the Wedgie anchors, and you can start from there.  A 60m rope will get you down to the bottom from the summit.

# Location
Sling Blade is a "second pitch" or extension of Wedgie, the 5.8 sport route in Jane's Chimney.  Once you've  clipped the chains of the Wedgie anchors, continue straight above for 3 bolts of steeper climbing.

# Protection
Bolts.
