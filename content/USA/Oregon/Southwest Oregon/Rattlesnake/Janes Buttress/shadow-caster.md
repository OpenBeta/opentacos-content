# Description
Another excellent climb on Jane's. A crux down low at the second bolt and some other cruxy climbing leads to a ledge after the sixth bolt. Climb through the headwall on steep rock to the top of the cliff, near the top of Mirror Image.

# Location
Between Split Decision and Lady in Red.

# Protection
Bolts. You can back-clean or set a long draw on the fourth bolt to cut rope drag.
