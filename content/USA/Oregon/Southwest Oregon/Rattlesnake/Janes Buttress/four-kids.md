# Description
One of several newer climbs on Jane's far right side. Climb direct to the first bolt (5.10) or traverse in from around the corner and pull onto the low-angle slab. From there it's all easier climbing on good holds and solid rock. This is becoming one of the more popular climbs at Rattlesnake for warming up and introducing newer climbers to the crag.

# Location
Furthest right of three bolted climbs that start from the nice built-up belay pad, just uphill from the main trail.

# Protection
Bolts, chain anchor.
