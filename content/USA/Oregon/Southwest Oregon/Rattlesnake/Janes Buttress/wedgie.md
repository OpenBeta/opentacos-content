# Description
The obvious chimney next to the fir tree, right/uphill from Split Decision. Climbs better than it looks, and is quite unique for the area. Awkward stemming gets you off the ground. Face holds mostly on the right supplement the leg action. Huge jugs at the top take you to the right onto a slopey ledge, from which you pull on a tree stump to the anchor. There appears to be a much harder extension above.There's a tree right next to the route covered in sticky sap. Make sure to avoid touching it

# Location
Right side of Jane's Buttress, in the obvious deep corner

# Protection
Bolts, anchor with chain
