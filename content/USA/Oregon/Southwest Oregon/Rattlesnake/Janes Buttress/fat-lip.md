# Description
Maybe if you bring a stick-clip for the first bolt then it's not so bad. Otherwise, it's bouldery, awkward moves through crappy rock to a strenuous clip, and then easy forgettable moves to the anchor shared with

Four Kids

. Not recommended.

# Location
Around the corner from

Four Kids

, far right side of Jane's Buttress

# Protection
Bolts, anchor with chains
