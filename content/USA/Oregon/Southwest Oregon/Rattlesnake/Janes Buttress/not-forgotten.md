# Description
Ridiculously short but otherwise quality climb with fun movement and good rock. Pull yourself off the ground on some big sidepulls, do a few crux moves between the second and third bolt, then finish on bigger holds with bad feet. Most enjoyable as a free-snake toprope as making clips interrupts the flow. But you also have to lead it because otherwise it doesn't count. Just kidding... sorta.

# Location
Way up the hill on the right side of Jane's. Past Four Kids and Fat Lip. Starts near a big madrone tree.

# Protection
Three bolts. Chain anchor. 15m rope required. Stick clip the chains if you want to TR first.
