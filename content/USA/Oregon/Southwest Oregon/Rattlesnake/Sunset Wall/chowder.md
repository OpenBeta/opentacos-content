# Description
Apparently you're supposed to climb up the right side of the bolt line. Maybe this is where the crux is. Otherwise climb the first two bolts of

The Clam

and make a fun, airy traverse right on sweet holds, which is easier.

# Location
Far left side of Sunset Wall, right of obvious

Clam

feature

# Protection
Bolts, anchor with rap hangers
