# Description
Great climb up a featured, overhanging arete. Easy start to a stance below the prow. Find good features to make the second clip then make a big move to a jug. Pull past this to another stance and a tricky step left where you can clip the chains.

# Location
Far left side of Sunset Wall, past

The Clam

, before you reach the bolted boulder problems
