# Description
Really fun for how short it is! Layback (and jam, if you can) up the rounded flake, getting a high foot to help through the crux. Continue up then step left, ducking under the overhang. Shimmy left and make an awkward clip of the chains.

# Location
Far left side of Sunset Wall, obvious rounded flake beneath an overhang

# Protection
Bolts, anchors with rap hangers
