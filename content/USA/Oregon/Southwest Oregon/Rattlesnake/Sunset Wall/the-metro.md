# Description
Fun roof climb. Some long reaches on big holds on steep terrain. After clipping the first bolt, step left, then go straight up to follow the path of least resistance through the roof. Shares the first bolt with  'Pleasure Victim'.

# Location
Near the end of the Sunset wall.

# Protection
Four bolts. Some folks might enjoy a stick clip. Chains on top.
