# Description
Short route with decent holds. Its worth doing a lap if you're breaking into 5.10s. The rock at the start is less than perfect, but is more solid up top. Don't let the moss at the top intimidate you.

# Location
Starts left of the large roof of "the Metro". There's a large, flatish boulder at the base you can stand on for the start.

# Protection
3 bolts. 2 Rap Hangers for the anchor
