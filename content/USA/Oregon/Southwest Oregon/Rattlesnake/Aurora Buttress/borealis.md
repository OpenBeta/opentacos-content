# Description
Start by stemming through a wide flare to a no-handed stance. Then pull onto the bulging ar√©te for a short crux leading to moderate climbing that takes you to the top. Good climb but definitely a two-move-wonder. Bolt placement makes this awkward to work the crux or TR.

# Location
Immediately left of Aurora. Second bolt line left of the prominent Thumper crack.

# Protection
8-ish bolts. Top (currently) has carabiners to lower off.
