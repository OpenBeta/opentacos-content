# Description
One of the better crack climbs at Rattlesnake. The first part has bolts on it to protect the face climbing though friable rock. The crux, a thin finger lock move, and the second half of the route are protected by gear.

# Location
Highly visible crack near the end of the buttress. Hard to miss!

# Protection
Four bolts down low. Gear .5-2 inches. Rap hangers on top.
