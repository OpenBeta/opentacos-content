# Description
This route has a bit of everything- jugs, crimps, underclings, monos, sidepulls, high steps, and a nice tree to bonk your butt on (tree is off). A ledge at the right of the third bolt provides a nice rest before the crux, where a beautiful 3 finger pocket gives you confidence to push on. While the crack on the right appears enticing, make sure you stay left so you can clip the next bolts.

Since this route is on a west facing wall, it tends to be warm from the afternoon light throughout the winter.

# Location
The only route on the backside of Cloud Buttress. The route begins near a tree on the wall, and can be accessed up a slippery trail from the area in between the Long Wall and Cloud Buttress.

# Protection
Protected by 6 bolts. The anchor consists of rap hangers
