# Description
Loose rock leads to solid climbing on fins, cracks and flakes. A ledge lets you rest up before taking on three bolts worth of overhanging crux on big holds.

# Location
Just up hill from the start of Cloud Drifter on the east side of the Cloud Buttress.

# Protection
10 Bolts. Rap hangers on top.
