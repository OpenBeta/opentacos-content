# Description
Great climb in the shade with good views. Â This is the left-most of the downhill-facing Dominator Routes.

Long climb with crux at 3/4ths height, the whole thing is good and sustained except for the awkward and crumbly start (welcome to Rattlechoss). There's still some tricky climbing to do once you get past the crux. Watch out for poison oak in the summer.

Take 12-ish draws plus anchor gear. A 60m rope will barely get you down. FA by Bill NewComb.
