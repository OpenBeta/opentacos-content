# Description
This climb was partially prepped by Jerry Messinger in the early 2000s. Bolting was finished and the climb FA'd by Charlie Brown in late 2020.

Start on Slim Pickens and veer left after the 3rd bolt, pulling on some small edges on less than vertical rock, leading to steeper terrain midway. Pull a crux move off a marginal shake at 3/4s height and endure pumpy climbing on good holds to the top of the cliff.

# Location
Low on the west-facing side of the Dominator Wall. Same start as Slim Pickens (brown bolts). If you have the guide book, this climb is marked "This Ain't Area 51 Project"

# Protection
12 bolts. Chain anchor with carabiners
