# Description
A newer addition to the Dominator wall. Start in a mini dihedral and then up a crunchy lichen-covered slab. Step right to some steeper moves on cleaner rock (avoid the vein of black choss left of the bolt line). The last few bolts are big holds on overhanging rock. The first ascent did a “second pitch” by stepping left from the chains and climbing to the top of the cliff via the crack. Everyone else just lowers from the chains.

# Location
First route after you turn the corner to the west-facing side of the Dominator Wall. Look for the brown bolt hangers.

# Protection
Bolts. Chains on top.
