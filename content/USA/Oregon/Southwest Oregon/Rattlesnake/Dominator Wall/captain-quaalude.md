# Description
It's hard to tell from the ground but this climb is the steepest section of rock on this part of the wall. Big holds to start lead to a 3-move crux in the tight flare. After clipping the 4th bolt, hand traverse the ledge to the 'Chainsaw' anchor (right).

# Location
Immediately left/uphill of Chainsaw Psycho Dork. The approach spur takes you to the belay pad.

# Protection
5 bolts. Shares chain anchor with 'Chainsaw'. Some loose rock below the first bolt so stick clip might be a good idea.
