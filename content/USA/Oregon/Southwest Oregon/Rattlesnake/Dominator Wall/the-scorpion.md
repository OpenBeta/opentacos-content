# Description
Mega! Climbs the arete at the lowest point of the Dominator Wall. Bouldery crux comes at about 1/3 height. Then climb to a ledge shared with "Dead Souls". After that it's go-time with a pumpy overhanging knife-edge arete and another crux move at the second to last bolt. Again... MEGA!

# Location
At the lowest point of the Dominator wall. Starts right off the approach trail. Right of "Dead Souls".

# Protection
Many bolts (14?) and rap hangers. You'll use about every inch of your 60m rope to lower off so tie a knot in the end!
