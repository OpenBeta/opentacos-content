# Description
Maybe some holds have broken off, but this felt way harder than the 10d grade given. Really tough moves and clips through the first 4-5 bolts. Thin crimps and pockets on a vertical face, with some moss and lichen to make things extra tricky. Eventually the face tilts in and a crack makes things a bit easier until you reach the last tricky move right before the anchor.

# Location
Down the hill from

Arabesque

, left of two bolt lines on this lower face

# Protection
Bolts, anchor with rap hangers
