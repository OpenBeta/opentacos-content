# Description
Climb tightly bolted choss for about 6 bolts. It gets better the higher you climb. Take the right of two bolt lines above on much more solid rock. Some long reaches on positive pockets and edges take you to the top of the formation. This climb shares its chossy start with two other climbs: a nails-hard 5.11+ slab that goes left. Or you can skip the best climbing and bail out right via an easy low-angle dihedral (Mountain Lion's Perch, requires gear or a short runout).

# Location
On the outside of the Cathedral, just right of the Window.

# Protection
11 (ish) bolts. Rap anchor. Stick clip is not a bad idea since the rock below the first bolt is bad and the stance for the belayer isn't great.
