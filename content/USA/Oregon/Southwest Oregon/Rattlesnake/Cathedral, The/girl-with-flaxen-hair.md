# Description
Climbs the sweet headwall that hangs over the approach trail. Starts inside the Cathedral with a few bolts of crumbly sidepulls. Pull over a bulge to a good stem rest (shared start with the Iceman dihedral, aka: "Mossman"). From the stem, move left onto the headwall. Climb awesome pockets and edges up the slightly overhanging wall to the top.

# Location
The first route on the right inside the Cathedral. Shares a start with Iceman and Rattlesnake Reality.

# Protection
8 bolts. Rap hangers on top.
