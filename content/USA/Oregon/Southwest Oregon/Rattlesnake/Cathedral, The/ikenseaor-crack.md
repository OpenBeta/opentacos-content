A very thin seam on an overhanging wall. The crux move is above the last bolt as you execute a cool "dynamic stem" with plenty of rope between you and your last draw. 5.8/9 chimney moves to the top.

# Location
Inside the Cathedral. The second route to the left of the Window.

# Protection
Four well-spaced bolts. Chain anchor.
