# Description
A fun climb in a great spot. Arabesque is a good warmup and probably the most popular route at Rattlesnake. Start on the belay spot, make a move or two straight right, then head straight up. Fun and exposed near the top. You can set a top rope by hiking around to the top but you'll want to add directionals to a few of the bolts.

# Location
On the west-facing side of the outer wall of the Cathedral.

# Protection
Bolts. Rap anchors.
