# Description
Powerful start out an undercut. Then jams and liebacks on an offset flare. Pull a roof and then traverse right along the ceiling of the Cathedral to the anchors. Physical and powerful climbing. Solid rock the whole way.

# Location
Inside the Cathedral on the "Main Wall" , directly across from the window.

# Protection
Six bolts, chain anchors. Getting to the second bolt can be sketchy. If you have a stick clip, go straight to the second bolt and don't feel bad about it.
