# Description
Short but packs a punch! Bouldery moves up the middle of a broad pillar on the edge of the Cathedral. Big moves out the undercut to start, some thin and techy stuff in the middle, and an extra vicious bit right at the end for ya. Have fun!

# Location
Across from Arabesque. On the right as you approach. Look for the long chain anchors.

# Protection
4 bolts, chain anchor
