# Description
The bolt line just left of Window Seat. Starts facing out the window of the cathedral on the left pillar. Climbs straight up to the shared anchors with Window Seat. Low moves on far apart holds into the crux, which comes when the angle steepens and you have to use two glued holds and some small 2-3 finger pockets. Not over until you clip the chains but eases slightly once you get the rail next to the last bolt.

# Location
Just left of Window Seat (the overhanging crack just to the right.

# Protection
4-5 bolts? Chains on the anchors. Stick clip optional. The moves to the first bolt are easy but on slightly suspicious rock.
