# Description
Tiptoe through a few stiff moves so-so rock until a good rest then pull a fun boulder problem crux to a big ledge. After the ledge climb some blocky terrain before pulling one more crux sequence to the top of the cliff.

# Location
Right-most climb on the outer (downhill facing) side of the Cathedral. As you approach the Cathedral along the Long Wall take a trail downhill to the left. Secret Forest is the first climb you come to.

# Protection
12(?) bolts, rap hangers. First bolt is easily clipped from the ground. Easy access to anchors from the top.
