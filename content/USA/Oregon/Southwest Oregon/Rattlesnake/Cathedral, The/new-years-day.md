# Description
Stem out onto the boulder to get started (or don't, good luck with that). Move right onto the face using big holds, which quickly disappear. Balance and finesse will get you through the low troubles. Pockets and tiny edges appear just when you need them, and get bigger as you get higher. The face gradually turns into a slab, and you can romp through the last moves to the anchor.

# Location
Leftmost route outside the Cathedral on the side without the window, slightly uphill

# Protection
Bolts, anchors with chains
