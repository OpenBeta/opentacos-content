# Description
Start with your hands and feet on opposite side of the arete.  Side pull on the right and side crimp the edge of a sharp flake to the left.  A few wide slopers give hand moves leading to a possible heel hook (or not) that aids in gaining the high left hand followed by a match with the right.  Next is a spicy match in the "choss trough" followed by the bump to the savior of a blind crimp rail that you cant see until your in it!  Easy moves top out on the lower boulder.

# Location
Walking up to the face of the Cougar Cave Boulder, the route lies just to the left of the first overhanging face and left of "Satanic Solution", starting on the arete and moving slightly left.
