# Description
Walk to the right up into the first cave.  Route starts with a small left crimp and a right hand ledge in the cave on opposing sides of the roof.  Feet start with a toe hook in between the roof and the main boulder.  Negotiate matching hands on the horn and gain the high foot.  Big moves onto a solid rail rest as a high heel hook propels the last thuggy moves before pulling a big flake to top out.
