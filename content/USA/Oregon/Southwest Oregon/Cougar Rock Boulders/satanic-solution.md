# Description
Lie down to start on the face of the boulder.  Left hand starts around the left side of the arete on the low percentage pinch/crimp.  Right hand starts in cracked holds on right side of Arete.  Feet start in triangular crack/tooth that leads into the dirt.  Negotiate a tricky start to pull off the ground and progress left hand into a razor crimp before thugging into the solid ledge above. From here fire right to the flake and stand up on the ledge using a greasy sloper.  Move straight up topping out on the first boulder.  Careful not to go right or left as a move off route is a fireable offense!  The start is the crux, and the rest....it's history.

# Location
