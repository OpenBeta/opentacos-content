# Description
Start deep in the bottom flaring off width chimney with hands matched on a large ledge and feet place on two small edges below.  Stand up on the feet and jam/arm bar/stem into the narrowing top of the crack.  Lean back into a committing quarter hand (thumb) mantle as you squirm sideways up the chimney using toe/heel hooks to fight your way up into an opposing flake and eventually a solid fist jam.  Feet go even with or over your head as you jam the narrowing top of the chimney and fight hard for the sloper on the face where the crack flares toward the approach trail.  Once established on the face continue scary crimps and face moves into the flaring crack at the top of the boulder.  Find your feet and pull over the steep and overhanging face to gain a solid flake as the boulder slabs out, topping out on the rock for the exciting finish!

# Location
Route starts just past the first cave and "Dripping Sun".  Look for the short off width to fist chimney leading onto a short face.
