# Description
Traverse first 20ft to the right to an obvious crack. Climb up the crack, using face/holds to the right when appropriate. While there are many places for pro, the rock gets very loose at points. Caution advised both for rockfall potential and gear giving way. Also, we climbed through/around a fair number of bushes.

# Location
Scramble to base of upper limpy rock. From parking, this is towards middle limpy, to the ridge between upper and lower middle limpy, then route begins on your left, on Upper Limpy.

# Protection
standard rack. belay off trees (no anchors)
