# Description
North face of the Brick House boulder, immediately right of the big off-width splitting the face in half. Start at the crack edge and step on numerous 1" footholds as you climb straight up whereas the crack leans left. Look carefully for sparce finger jams and solid underclings while avoiding moss and loose rock. Just enough features for normal protection to avoid an R rating. Immediately below fragile flakes 25' from top, step up and right over loose blocks to a pair of bolt anchors on the highest solid rock on the face (no chains).

See photo for rope and anchor positioning. Original route likely ascends a broken thin-fingered crack straight up the center of the tall right-hand portion of boulder (needs separate description)

# Location
North side faces away from rim road. Start just right of obvious off-width.

# Protection
Cams 0.25 to 2"
