# Description
If you are a confident climber, it wouldn't hurt to skip the first bolts, or stick clip the third bolt for a smoother belay. The Crux is the second move after starting. Itâ€™s a small jump to a mono/two finger pocket off a small sloper and crimp pocket (v3/v4). After that, you are left with some pumpy moves on a slight overhang. No specific beta after the crux move. The route is brand new as of March 2018.

# Location
The Route is on the South Comb on the overhang beginning the Lavatube. Follow the road going to the right side of the Southcomb.

# Protection
Sport climbing. Can be done with 7 quickdraws. Route is well protected. There is a set of anchors at top with Stainless steel permadraws.
