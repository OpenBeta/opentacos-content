# Description
Scramble up the base of the tube to eyeball the first bolt. There it is, a beautiful stainless steel bolt with nasty/banger glue. Now begin ascending the overhung pocket fest. Some big jugs toward the crux will help you send. Those with a decent  ape index could have a lot of fun with those jugs while adding in a dyno or two. Creative options are in the air. Now the crux is half way up the route and it’s a mantle. Have fun with that! Mantle the crux and then finish to the anchors. It is a new route and there will be choss ( chiseled away at the bottom section as much as was reasonable), but it is a great short route and as sweet as honey!
