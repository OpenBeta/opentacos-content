# Description
This climb leads straight out of a small cave to the top of the clock tower. Numerous large features make for great holds, but the exposure and incline of the wall can make the route feel more difficult. Once you reach the top, be aware of loose rocks and dirt. There is a bolted anchor, but it is a ways back from the edge, so it is easier to just top belay your partner to the summit of the pinnacle.

To get down, a second bolted anchor contains rap rings that makes it easy to get back to where you started. Make the short rap back down to the saddle or a 250+- foot rappel to the base of Clock Tower's south wall. Another set of rappel anchors can be found on a large shelf about 2/3 down.

# Location
The climb begins on the side closest to Raptors bluff, in between the main rock and the Clock Tower. A small but slippery cave can serve as a belay station.

Walk through the secret cleft to Raptors Bluff, and rappel down to the Â upper saddle of the Clock Tower.

# Protection
Protected by 5 bolts. Anchor at top
