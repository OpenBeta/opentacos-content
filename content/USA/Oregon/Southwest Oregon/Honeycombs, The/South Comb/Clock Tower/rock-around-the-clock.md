# Description
This route starts in a small cave on the West side of the Clock Tower and traverses out to the right. A second bolt line is about 8 feet out, and then head up the wall. Near the top, be aware of loose rocks and debris that are easy to knock off. There is a bolted anchor at the top, but it is difficult to set up a top rope. Plan on top belaying your partner to the top of the pinnacle, and then rappelling off via another anchor with rap rings

Update (10/2019) Rock Around the Clock can now be climbed as the second pitch to the two lower routes that begin on left side of the lower wall.

# Location
The climb begins on the side closest to Raptors bluff, in between the main rock and the Clock Tower. A small but slippery cave can serve as a belay station. The climb begins on a bolt line out to the right from the cave.

To get to the clock tower, follow a lightly traveled trail along the East side of the South Comb. A steep and eroded trail will then lead you to the start of the climb. You can also walk through the secret cleft to Raptors Bluff, and rappel down to the Clock Tower.

# Protection
Protected by 3 bolts. Anchor
