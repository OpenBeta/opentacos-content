# Description
P1: Shares first ~10 ft with Time Warp. From second bolt Time Warp climbs left and follows left line to left side of large belay ledge, sharing belay anchors with cicadian hearthob. Hearthrob climbs right from second bolt. follow this bolt line avoiding the temptation to cross onto Time Warp.

P2: From the belay ledge you have the option to:

1.) continue on to the summit by climbing out the left side of the ledge and straight up linking with Rock Around the Clock (5.8) or

2.) follow the arete (Pitch 2 of Time Warp, 5.7+) directly above the belay.

3.) cross onto the arete and then move right following the boltline just right of the arete (Deadbeat's pitch-2, 5.9)

4.) climb out the right side of the belay ledge following the second pitch of Bare Naked Solstice Party (5.9) to the top.

If you are continuing on either the 2nd pitch of HeartthrobÂ or Bare Naked Solstice Party, continuing on in a second pitch is recommended for reducing rope drag.
