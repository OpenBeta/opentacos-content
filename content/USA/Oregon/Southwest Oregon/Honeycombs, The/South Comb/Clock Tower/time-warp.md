# Description
P1: Shares first ~10 ft with Deadbeat's Escapement From second bolt Time Warp climbs left and follows left line to the left side of large belay ledge, sharing belay anchors with Deadbeat. Deadbeat climbs right from second bolt while Time Warp continues straight up.

P2: From the belay ledge you have the option to continue on to the summit by climbing out the left side of the ledge and straight up linking with Rock Around the Clock (5.8) or follow the arete (Pitch 2 of Time Warp, 5.7+) directly above the belay. The third option is to cross onto the arete and then move right following the boltline just right of the arete (Evading Deadbeat's Escapement pitch-2, 5.9). Â A fourth option for summitting is to climb out the right side of the belay ledge following the second pitch of Bare Naked Solstice Party (5.9) to the top. If you are continuing on either the 2nd pitch of Deadbeat's Escapement or Bare Naked Solstice Party, continuing on in a second pitch is recommended for reducing rope drag.

# Location
At the bottom of the Clock Tower, Time Warp is the fifth and last bolt line from the right. Share first two bolts with Deadbeat's Escapement.
