# Description
Climb the wall to the left of the dark water streak.

# Location
After exiting the top of the Secret Cleft follow the trail to a small saddle where you will find top anchors without chains above the west wall. Use these anchors to rappel down onto the the large forested ledge above the Bouldering Tube.

Caution: watch for any potential rock fall hazards as you rappel over the top.

# Protection
Top anchor bolts, no chains.
