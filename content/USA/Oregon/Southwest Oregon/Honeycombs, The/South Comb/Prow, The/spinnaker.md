# Description
This route consists of slabby moves mixed with small vertical faces. People tend to climb right and around the first steep section (5.6), if so they are out of sight of the belayer and need to understand "slack" and "take" commands to the belay. The exposure near the top is quite nice, especially with the recent logging and becomes the crux of the climb. There are anchor bolts at the base for the belayer to clip into. You can also access this climb from the top if you hike up the secret cleft.

# Location
Scramble up the left side of the Prow. The climb is the first bolted route you see that runs almost right up the middle.

# Protection
Bolts. Anchor with rap rings
