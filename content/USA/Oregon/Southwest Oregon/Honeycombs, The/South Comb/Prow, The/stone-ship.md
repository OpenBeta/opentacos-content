# Description
Find two belay anchors on the belay ledge on the right side of the rock just above the third landing. climb about 25 feet to head wall past a bolt. At the headwall climb right around and on top the headwall. From on top the headwall follow the bolt line to the top.

This is a fun knobby route climbed as either an approach scramble or 5.0 climb has great exposure. A great way to introduce people to the South Comb is to take climb Stone Ship and then hike the knife ridge trail out through the Secret Cleft.

# Location
From third landing find a short gully with a down log. Scramble up the gully to a belay ledge to the right of the gully where you will find two belay anchors.

# Protection
Route is bolted or all top anchors are easily accessible from the ridge trail.
