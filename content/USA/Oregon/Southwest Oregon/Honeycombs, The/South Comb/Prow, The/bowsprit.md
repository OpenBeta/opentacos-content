# Description
Fun climb. Same start as spinnaker but with same first clip then follows what few bolts there are to left ending at the prominent sharp prow in the rock on top. The fist third of the climbing is low angle class IV with protection on the three crux steep or slight overhangs. If you are not judicial in you clips and choose to clip bolts on the lower angle bottom third rope drag will become an issue towards the top.

Top anchors are easily accessible for toproping via the secret cleft trail.

# Location
From the trail accessing the from the log landing below to the Prow, scramble ~10 feet up to walkway that takes you around left side of the Prow where you will find four sets of bottom belay anchors. Use the first set of belay anchors. The last set of belay anchors will be located just above a tree around the left side. Note: as you walk around on the walkway you will be about 30 feet above the lower road.

# Protection
Fixe glue-in bolts, chains on top, easily accessed for toproping via Stone Ship (5.0) or the Secret Cleft Trail.

PG = exposure and leads may generally be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.
