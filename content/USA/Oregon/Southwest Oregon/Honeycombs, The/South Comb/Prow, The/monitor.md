# Description
Lots of big knobs on the way up. This route is protected with a single bolt that is also used as a directional when toproping. There is a single crux move at the bolt which is in sight of the bottom belay. Climbing to the right of this bolt seems to be easier for people to make than to the left. Past crux follow the path of least resistance to the summit. If needed you could probably sling a chicken head for protection on your way up.Â  Top anchors are second from the right.

# Location
From the bottom access the small lower cleft to the right onto a down log laying across the cleft. Find a set of belay anchors above this log up on the left. From the belay looking up and slightly left you will find the first and only bolt protecting this route.

# Protection
a single bolt, easily accessed belay anchors top and bottom, easily accessed anchors for toproping.

Exposure and leads on this route may generally be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.
