# Description
Climbs outside arete on left side of the Secret Cleft. Between the third and fourth bolt there is an easy scramble to large ledge accessing the upper arete. Climbing becomes more sustained near the the top were the most difficult moves are.

# Location
On the East Side of the South Comb, there is a steep gully with climbs on both sides. This is the secret cleft, and Edge of Fear follows the arete on the ridge on the East Side. The climb begins at the base of a tree just before you would begin the scramble to the top of the comb.

# Protection
8 bolts. Anchor with chains and rap rings
