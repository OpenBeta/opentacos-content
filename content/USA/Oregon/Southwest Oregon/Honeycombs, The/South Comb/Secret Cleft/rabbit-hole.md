# Description
A short but sweet climb. A slight overhang adds to the difficulty, but large holds makes the climb easier. The bolts are spaced out when the climbing is easy.

# Location
The climb begins way in the back right of the secret cleft. It is the further back of the two bolted routes.

# Protection
Protected by 3 bolts. Anchor with chains and rap rings
