# Description
A difficult start is aided by nice holds throughout the climb. This route is one of many in the area that are solid leads for a climber gaining experience with lead climbing. A set of rap rings about 2/3s of the way up makes toproping easier, but the actual route traverse to the right following the lip of the overhang where there is another set of anchors atop the small roof. From here, you can lead up a second pitch, and make it to the top. The second pitch is 5.6. Chains on summit. 30m rappel with 15m of air time.

# Location
Located on the North Face (Fire Dome) of the South Comb. It begins just to the left of the small area of shattered rock at the bottom in front of the face. It is very close to Mystic Monkey, so don't get them mixed up! See topo for reference

# Protection
6 bolts. Solid anchor with rap rings
