# Description
Immediately upon reaching South Comb, you will be staring at the face hosting Atrus Leap on the right side of the dark, solid slab. The left line, at 5.7, facilitates setting a TR and will provide a much happier rope-pulling experience after cleaning.

The crux comes right out the gate, followed by easier movement. A first bolt that can be clipped from standing prevents any unplanned downhill excursions. The belayer may consider slinging themselves to to the madrone tree in order to focus on belaying.

Once on top, do remember to turn around and admire the view.

# Location
As you walk to the South Comb, Atrus Leap is a bolted line that follows an arete on the right side of the South Comb. The belay area has been covered by recent logging and blasting, so the beginning of the climb is much different than it used to be. Some large boulders make for a nice spot to belay from though

# Protection
Protected by 10 bolts. Anchor with rap rings
