# Description
The crux of this route in the start, where you need to pull over a small roof. From here, follow the route to a ledge with a madrone tree. The route gets steeper from here, but eases up just before the top.

# Location
This route is located on the East Side of the Fire Dome. Walk towards the secret cleft, and the route begins just to the left of a small overhang with darker rock at the base.

# Protection
Protected by 9 bolts. Anchor with rap rings
