# Description
A great warm up route for all climbers at Honeycombs. Lots of nice holds continuously up the face. At the start, a single bolt can stop your climber from taking a tumble down the hill, but once you get the second clip, you can undo the first one to reduce rope drag.

# Location
Located at the North Face (Fire Dome) of the South Comb. It faces directly into the new clearing made by logging, so has easy access. See topo photo for reference.

# Protection
Protected 9 bolts. Has anchor with chains and rap rings
