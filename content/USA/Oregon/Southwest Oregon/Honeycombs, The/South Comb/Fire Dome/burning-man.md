# Description
Climbs straight up and through overhanging roof above.

5.6 to fist clip and then becomes progressively more difficult with each clip with a .10a finish over the overhang crack or 5.8 finish moving left at the overhang.

Tops out at chain anchors on the ledge on top the overhang (top of first pitch to Double Jointed). Or, continue straight up to the summit on the second pitch to Double Jointed (5.6).

# Location
Between Candy Shop and Double Jointed. First clip just left of the faded 55+22 orange painted survey marking. Note that the glue-in bolts used on Burning Man are not as visible as the bolts + hangers used on Double Jointed.

# Protection
Fixe glue-in
