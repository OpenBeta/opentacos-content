# Description
The prominent crack on the Dawn Wall.

# Location
Toprope:  Hike down  from the South Comb road and before you reach the South Comb, find a rough trail and hike down the hill past cairns, and then ascend to the top of the lower main tower of the formation.  There is a bolt near the scrubby pine tree.  This allows for a 40' rappel down easy 5th class to the anchors at the top of the climb next to the  tree.  There's another set of anchors on mossy ledge @90' below, and the ground is 100' from there.

# Protection
Toprope!
