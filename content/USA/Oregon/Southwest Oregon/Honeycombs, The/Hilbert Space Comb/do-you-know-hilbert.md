# Description
This is a pumpy route covered in pockets, crimps, and buckets which vary in light steepness. It’s pretty dirty now, but with more traffic, and a more prepared trail/belay station, this route may become a perfect 10a for a nice unimpressive day at the crag. A very fun route (though very dirty currently).
