# Description
This generously bolted route pulls around a ceiling on mostly good holds, followed by substantially easier climbing above leading to a euro-anchor. The crux is one's  willingness to pull through on painfully sharp holds.

# Location
Left side of the north comb hemicylinder called Orange Bowl. Look for the unmistakable ceiling line at the hand-built rock wall.

# Protection
9 bolts
