# Description
Starts on a slight overhang flat face with pockets, moving over a small roof. After the roof, you trend up and right through large holds to the base of a large overhung wall. This marks the crux of the climb. After pulling on top of the overhung wall, you will find one more bolt before the anchor.

# Location
The climb begins on the base of the North Comb closest to the upper logging platform. Near the bottom of the wall, there is an orange spray painted W. The climb begins about 5 feet to the right of the W.

# Protection
Protected by 9 bolts. Anchor with chains
