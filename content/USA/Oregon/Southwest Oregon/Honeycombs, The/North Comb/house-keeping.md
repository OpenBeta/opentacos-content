# Description
Bolt line starts left of obvious crack feature. Â Climbing becomes progressively more difficult as the wall steepens and then eases up before the finish

# Location
From the trail above the North Comb, follow it through switchbacks until you reach a series of belay platforms going down the hill. The climb begins at the last belay station in the series.

You can also access the climb by following the logging road until the base of the North Comb, and then walking up the comb until you reach the lower belay station.

# Protection
9 bolts. Anchor with rappel chains
