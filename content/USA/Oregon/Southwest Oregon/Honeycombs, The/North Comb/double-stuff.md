# Description
Start on jugs for 2 clips (Evidently a new 1st bolt has been added since Orton described a 20' runout to the 1st clip). Take on a slightly exciting runout on easy (but dirty) terrain to the 3rd before sportier bolting takes over. After the last bolt, go around the buckets to the anchor atop the dome.

One may find oneself advantaged by bringing a sling clip. A 60 will barely reach the ground. Bump to a .10a if you have to skip holds due to wasps :)

# Location
Just downhill of Housekeeping, around the hueco-filled wall with the (W). Walk down the ridge trail and switch back, don't wall-traverse down. You can also walk down the logging road, and the wall is located right next to the first logging platform that you reach. The climb begins just to the left of the orange W on the wall

# Protection
11 bolts, anchor with rap rings
