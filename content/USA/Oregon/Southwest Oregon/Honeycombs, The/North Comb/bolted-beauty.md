# Description
Starts off with the crux at the start, with tough holds to find. From here, slab climbing requires balance towards the steeper top of the route

# Location
Located on the East Side of the North Comb. The climb begins at the highest belay station in the series, and is the first route you see if you are approaching the crag via trail. It is the furthest route to the right on the wall.

# Protection
Protected by 8 bolts. Anchor with rap rings
