# Description
Lost World is commonly done is two pitches, but a very small third pitch can be added at the start to get access to a better belay station.

The climb begins with easy climbing on some dirty rock where it leads to a large platform. There is a bolted anchor here if you would like to belay your partner up so they have a better place to belay from.

The climb then leads up a slightly overhung face. A bolt line of glue in's lead straight up the face where numerous holds and foot placements are present, but the climbing is quite sustained. A second line of bolts goes to the right, which is a 10b alternative. Both lines finish at a bolted anchor with a nice belay station.

The final pitch has a mix of slab and roof mantles. Follow the ridge all the way to the summit where a bolted anchor marks the end of the climb.

To get down, you can either walk off the North Comb or you can rappel down the route. There is a rappel station at each belay platform.

# Location
From the upper logging platform, a small and slippery trail runs along the base of the North Comb. Follow this trail down about 30 feet, and the climb is the first bolted route on the right. A small spur runs to the start of the climb.

# Protection
The longest pitch contains 9 bolts. Each belay station has a bolted anchor and rappel station
