# Description
Climb the offwidth overhanging crack past two bolts and a horn.  This is the crux and maybe 5.8.  Pull into the chimney and climb past two bolts, then exit the chimney onto the diving board platform feature on the tower.  Traverse the wide ledge around to the outside of the tower and clip the last bolt.  To eliminate rope drag, you can belay here or reset the rope out of the chimney.  Climb the detached block to the top.  There are no bolts in the detached block but the climbing is 5.easy and there are pockets that take .75 cam.  Two bolts on the summit with rap rings, 100' to the ground.

# Location
This climb is on BLM land.  The route begins at the wide crack separating the leaning tower from the main rock.

# Protection
Five bolts.  Additional gear placements are possible in various pockets.
