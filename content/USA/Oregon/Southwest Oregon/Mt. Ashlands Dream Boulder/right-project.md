# Description
Start on good holds down low. Feet can start on a low block of rock down low. Make a move out left to a good set of holds and a small slot. Heel hook up left, grab a crap half moon dish with your right hand and then try and grab something even higher. Stumped at that point.

# Location
Easy descent.

# Protection
Pad.
