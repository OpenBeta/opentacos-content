# Description
Start sitting. Left hand on a sweet pinch on the arete and right hand on a wicked side pull that is at an angle just ok enough to use. Paste feet on bad crystals. Slap right hand up to a good sidepull. Bump left hand up to another good vertical rail. Hug the arete all the way up and top out on using a 128 hours chock block. Holds get good when the lichen gets bad.

# Location
Easy descent.

# Protection
Pad.
