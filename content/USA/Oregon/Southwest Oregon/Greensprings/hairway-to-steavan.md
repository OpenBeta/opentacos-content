# Description
Fun jumpy "coordination" moves for the first 3 bolts leading to nondescript pebbly edges typical of Greenspings. Skip the first janky anchor at the ledge and pull the bulge to a better anchor at the top of the cliff.

# Location
Climbs the most prominent column next to the flat boulder where you've probably already yardsale'd your gear. Second boltline right of "Sky Patrol".

# Protection
Bolts.
