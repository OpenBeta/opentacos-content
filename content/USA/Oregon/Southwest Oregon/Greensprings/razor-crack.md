# Description
Rated 5.7 in Greg Orton's guide book.  That is quite a sandbag!  Or maybe a mistake since the topo on page 45 indicates the crack as a 5.12b.  Most importantly, Razor Crack is the classic finger and hand crack of Ashland, Oregon.

Morning shade is pleasant, even when Ashland's high temperatures are in the 90F range.

There is poison oak, hidden amongst the Oregon grape where you may want to pile your rope.

# Location
Where the trail meets the cliff, go right.

# Protection
.4 to #4 camalots

Nice chains on the two bolt anchor.
