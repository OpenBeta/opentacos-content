# Description
This is the thin crack just to the right of the route "Boys who aren't French".  Climb the initial slab placing a small piece or two.  Continues with moderate face climbing with a little bit of finger crack action.  The crux comes at the top of the route and is a bit committing.

# Location
Once at the top of the approach head left towards the Marge formation.  Sky Pilot is to the right of Marge, and just to the left of Boys Who Aren't French.

# Protection
Finger sized pieces, nuts.
