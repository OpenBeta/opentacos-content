# Description
Start with Marge's Navel and continue to the top. A few .ll moves with closely spaced bolts to good anchors and a beautiful view of the valley.

Can be top roped by scrambling up the far left side of the formation and stepping across to the column. Wouldn't recommend but there are good bolts on top for protection.

# Location
Obvious column that resembles Marge Simpson

# Protection
10ish bolts
