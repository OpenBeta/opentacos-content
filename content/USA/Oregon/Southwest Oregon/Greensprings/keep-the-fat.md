# Description
After free-soloing up 25 feet of moss covered rock, this route ascends the left most column of the middle section of Greensprings. The route from here has juggy sidepulls and delicate feet all the way to the summit of the column. This route doesn't see a lot of traffic, so be prepared for some overgrown trees and dirty rock for the start.

To reduce rope drag, unclip the second draw before moving on to the crux.

# Location
The approach trail ends at a lower "middle" section of the crag. The route ascends the left most column in this section. Look high to find the first bolt.

# Protection
Protected by 7 bolts. Bolted anchor with chains
