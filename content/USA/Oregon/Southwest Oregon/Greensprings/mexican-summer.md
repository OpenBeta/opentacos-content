# Description
11a in the book. Felt mid 11 if not 11+ to me.

Starts up a whole bunch of dirt and moss. Scary. Heads into a overhung section on clean rock with good holds. Awesome. Muscle up a runout arete on clean rock with akward clips and some ok shakes. Awesome and scary. Pulls another overhung section with a bolt lower than you want (learned that most people slot a cam here before pulling the last steep section).

If you can get over the mossy, dirt covered start, the rest of the move climbs well and had very enjoyable moves. A cam would have been really nice for the finishing crux but I didn't have one. The fall would be a little big if you blew the final moves which aren't that easy. Luckily I didn't take the ride but you might fall onto the slabby arete below. I remember being a touch spooked.

# Location
Isolated route to the right and around the corner from the Left Wall. Look for a start covered in moss leading into a striking steep section and then a nice looking arete.

# Protection
Bolts. Optional #1 or #2 cam per book
