# Description
From the north saddle ridge directly behind Eagle Rock follow the Parkway Ledge around the left (east) side of Eagle Rock to a little gap in the rock and a madrone. From the madrone climb the first wall section of 5.7 followed by 40 feet of 5.9 climbing with easier climbing past the second madrone. Expect the route to be a little mossy. PG = exposure and leads generally may be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.

# Location
From a madrone in the gap on the east side of Eagle Rock.

Refer to Rock Climbing Western Oregon, Vol. 2: Umpqua 2007 Map 4 page 226, Topo F page 235.

# Protection
