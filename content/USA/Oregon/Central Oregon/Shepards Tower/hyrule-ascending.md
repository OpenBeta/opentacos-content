# Description
Starts from ledge (but can direct start as "storming the castle"), then climbs the bolt line left of STC up the orange face.  Crux is near 2nd bolt moving through a series of liebacks to a huge jug.  Continues on BIG holds through steep block terrain to the anchors.   Anchors are just below the tower's top (similar to storming the castle) to faciliate rope line for lowering, but there are bolts on the summit to anchor to if you want to climb up and over.

# Location
Just to the left of storming the castle.

# Protection
bolts with DBA and mussy hooks at top..
