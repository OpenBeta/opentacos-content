# Description
Great position and perfect rock, Begin by stepping off the left side of the flat belay ledge on crisp edges. Mostly 5.10 climbing punctuated by a powerful crux above the third bolt involving a "two-by-four" pinch and a rail feature. The gently overhanging finish on horizontal slots and jugs is send-sational!

# Location
South face of the tower, left side.

# Protection
6 bolts, chain anchor.
