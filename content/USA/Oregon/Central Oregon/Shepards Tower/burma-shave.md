# Description
Beautiful golden face. Boulder off the ledge on sharp edges, consider stick clipping the first bolt if you're unsure about it (plenty of sticks around). Negotiate a short crux at the 3rd then it's all jugs to the finish, but a pump builds with the steep lockoffs. Easy to set a toprope after climbing the chimney. All day sun.

# Location
Center of the South face, TR variations possible.

# Protection
6 bolts
