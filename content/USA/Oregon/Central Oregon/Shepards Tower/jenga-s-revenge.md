# Description
Route is mostly juggy 5.8ish with a few well protected cruxes.  It stays on or just to the left of the arete, and pulls straight over the big hanging block near the top.  Tons of exposure with amazing holds throughout.  Same top anchors as for the crack route.  Can rap with a 60m rope.

# Location
Just to the right of the obvious crack (crack of noon 5.9+) on the downhill side of the formation.  Climbs the same arete as "Tetris" but on the left side of the arete.  Longest route on the tower.

# Protection
bolts, chain anchors
