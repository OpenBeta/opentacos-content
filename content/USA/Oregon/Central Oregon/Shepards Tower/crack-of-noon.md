# Description
A gritty adventure on a proud line. Start from the brushy ledge in a wide splitter. Follow the intermittent hand and finger crack, past a few ancient pitons, occasionally climbing out right on the face. Glorious finish hiking straight up big horizontals.

Not sure the history on this one. Considering the rock I cleaned from the start, I doubt the full line had been climbed before and unlikely that it was done free back in the day.

# Location
The tallest, downhill aspect of the tower, with a crack splitting the middle. Left of the sport routes.

# Protection
Single set cams to #4, optional extra hand size pieces. A bolt anchor was added to the top of this route June 2020
