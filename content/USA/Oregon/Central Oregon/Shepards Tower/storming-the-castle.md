# Description
Takes the obvious line up the blocky roofed arete just to the the right of "the moat" feature. Bouldery start to ledge then balance moves on thin hollow flakes lead to jug pulling straight through the roofs to the anchor.  Stellar setting.  Easy climbing above the chains if you want to top out on the tower.

# Location
The obvious blocky arete to the left of "the moat".

# Protection
bolts and chain anchor
