# Description
Sustained climbing with good holds up the overhanging face.  Starts with a bouldering move or two to reach the obvious flake. Great solid climbing with a slowly building pump.  Chain anchors or top out onto "rampart's ledge" for a great hangout spot.

# Location
The route that starts from the most uphill part of the tower.  Just left of short obvious chimney.

# Protection
bolts, chain anchors
