# Description
There are two cruxes on at the bottom and one at the top. the one at the bottom is right after the traverse you need to go up and there is an ok pocket it's better as an undercling/side pull. the next crux on the top is right before the top out which is a left-hand cross to a sloper and then you go to the jug Finnish hold and top out from there (I did not get the FA)

# Location
once you see the waterfall you keep on going straight until you see the place where every one cliff jumps (into the water) (that is where the route is) it's about 100 feet in front of the waterfall ( you can't miss it it's like a natural amphitheater. to start the climb there is a little trail that's more like a scramble to the start.

# Protection
don't need any gear besides your shoes and chalk bag because you fall into the water if you fall.
