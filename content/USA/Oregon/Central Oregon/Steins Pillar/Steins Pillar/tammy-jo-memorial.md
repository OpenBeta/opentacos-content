# Description
The route is 3 pitches long, all bolts. I believe you will need 12-15 quick draws. All anchors are bolts with chains on them. If you summit you must rap the North Face route ( all bolts with chains )a 60 meter rope will work with 4 rappels.

Pitch 1= 5.11a 80 feet

Pitch 2= 5.11c/d 80 feet (classic arete solid rock)

Pitch 3= 5.11c/d 100 feet

# Location
Left of the original Southwest face route. About 50 left of the dihedral on pitch 1 of the Southwest face.

# Protection
All bolts
