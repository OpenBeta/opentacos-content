# Description
Close Encounters shares the first 20 feet with Undertaker, then goes straight up the face and inside corner.  The "Close Encounter" comes near the top when it forces an up close and personal interaction with an intimidating overhang.

With the correct cryptic sequence, it feels easy for the grade.  Until that's deciphered, it feels nearly impossible.

For full value, climb the bolted off-width second pitch of Undertaker.

# Location
Located on the right side of the North facing, downhill side of Steins Overlook.  It starts at an overhanging fist crack protected by a single bolt.

# Protection
+/- 10 bolts
