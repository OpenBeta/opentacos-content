# Description
Friday the 13th features bouldery moves, a cryptic crux, and a persistent coating of lichen on the non-essential holds.  It shares the finishing moves and anchor with Honeybee.  Despite the name, it's well protected and safe.

# Location
The farthest uphill route on the east face of Steins Overlook.  It climbs through a black streak to the left of Honeybee.

# Protection
6 bolts to an anchor with steel 'biners.
