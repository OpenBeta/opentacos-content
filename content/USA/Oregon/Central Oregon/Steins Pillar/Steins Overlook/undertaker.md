# Description
Undertaker burls through several overhangs, and like everything else at the Overlook, it's steeper than it looks. Â Minor ledge fall potential and spaced bolting make this a good route to not fall on.

P1. Start at a boulder problem through an overhanging fist crack (.10+), after a shake at a ledge, step right and power past sloping melons on a steep, rounded arete. 9 bolts, 5.11a, 90 feet.

P2. Navigate one bulge after another while mostly avoiding OW moves in the six inch crack. 8 bolts, 5.10+, 90 feet.

Descent: If lowering from the second pitch anchor, make sure to clip a leash/draw to the belay end of the rope to pull back to the belay ledge rather than be stuck hanging in space. Or, top out and belay off the tree and scramble off.

# Location
Located on the North facing, downhill side of Steins Overlook. Undertaker is the second route right of a huge chimney/cave feature, and starts at an overhanging fist crack protected by a single bolt.

# Protection
All bolts with stainless steel 'biners on the anchors.
