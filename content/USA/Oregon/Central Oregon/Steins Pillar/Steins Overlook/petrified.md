# Description
P1. The all-bolted, 90 foot, first pitch works techy corner moves to a steep finish. 5.10d

P2. The signature second pitch ascends a very steep hand to fist crack through a "petrified" white streak. 5.10b

Descent: If lowering from the second pitch anchor, make sure to clip a leash/draw to the belay end of the rope to pull back to the belay ledge rather than be stuck hanging in space. Or, top out and belay off the tree and scramble off.

# Location
Petrified is on the north facing, downhill side of Steins Overlook.  It starts immediately left of a large chimney/cave feature.

# Protection
P1. 10 bolts to anchor with steel 'biners

P2. 2 bolts and enough #1 to #4 camalots for a 100 foot pitch (doubles or triples). No stoppers or small cams. Bolted anchor with steel 'biners.
