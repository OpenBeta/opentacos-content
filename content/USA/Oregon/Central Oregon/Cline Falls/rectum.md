# Description
Start on a sweet jug pocket. Work up into slots under mini roof then make a big dead point to an awesome jug with some bird poop chalk. A great warmup!

# Location
Located in Cline Falls. This little bouldering zone is the first cliffband on the left hill before the parking loop. Rectum is on the tallest part of the cliff up the center of the pretty face.

# Protection
Pads. The top is a little slippery.
