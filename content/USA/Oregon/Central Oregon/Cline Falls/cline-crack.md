# Description
Short, steep corner crack. Boulder off the ground past some slippery paint. Stemming and tips laybacks lead around a roof to the finish. Feels a little harder than Wartley's?

# Location
Right of the sport route, by the gnarly narwhal petrograph.

# Protection
Double set of cams from tips to BD #.75. Two bolt anchor. May be more practical to lead rather than drop a TR from the above, due to the steep leaning nature and the 10 foot boulder behind your back.
