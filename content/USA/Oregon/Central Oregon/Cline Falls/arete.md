# Description
Cline Falls is a very small climbing area located on the outskirts of Redmond. Until just recently, there have only been a couple short routes, but some traveling climbers found some motivation to do a day of bouldering on this short, volcanic cliffband.

Cig-arete climbs up the beautiful, and tallish (for Cline Falls) arete on the most eye catching part of the bouldering cliffband. Start on a jug undercling, and move up through sharp holds to a massive and height dependent move to a left hand sloper. Keep it together and top out with ease. This line offers super cool movement and is close to the car, making it a fun outing if Smith Rockâ€™s small bouldering circuit is too boring.

# Location
Start standing on a jug undercling flake. This is the pretty arete on the right side of the tallest face on the small cliff line. Park on the road under the wall.

# Protection
2-4 pads
