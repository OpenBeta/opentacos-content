# Description
Begin scrambling up a grassy ledge, then either jam or use small face holds to establish yourself in the tight dihedral.  Use more shenanigans to move up over the slight overhang and mantle to the anchor.  I can't justify calling it 5.10a due to only having one or two tricky moves, but it is certainly more awkward and strenuous than your run of the mill 5.9.

You can set up a TR from a tree back from the edge a few feet, or do the exposed one move downclimb to the ledge where the anchor is.  I wouldn't recommend the latter without a rappel/belay of some sort.

# Location
Walk downstream maybe 50 yards from the bolted prow and look for an arching, tight dihedral.

# Protection
Cams in the .4-.75 BD range.  2 bolt anchor.  Top out to clean gear from anchor.
