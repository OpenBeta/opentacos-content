# Description
The crux comes in the first 15 feet. Fiddle some small gear and pull through a bulge on a few finger locks and face holds. The difficulty eases in the second half.

# Location
Left of the sport route

# Protection
Small cams to #.75, maybe a few small nuts. Two bolt anchor, you can access from the rim to clean your gear or establish a TR. A tree 20 feet back provides an anchor if needed.
