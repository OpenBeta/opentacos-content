# Description
Bouldery start leads to a easier climbing until the sustained crux that consists of wild bear hugging moves full of desperation.  Super clean and brilliant moves - if you can make them.

# Location
third bolted route from the left.  Between the classic crack routes.

# Protection
bolts, DBA at top
