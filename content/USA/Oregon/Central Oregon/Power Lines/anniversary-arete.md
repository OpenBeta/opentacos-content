# Description
This short but fun route is powerful and challenging. The bolts are nicely placed so that you are always clipping off of something positive. The route has three distinct boulder problem like cruxes that are super fun and unique.

# Location
To the right of blockdown, it's an obvious pillar that is set apart just to the left of the obvious main wall.

# Protection
bolts, chains at top
