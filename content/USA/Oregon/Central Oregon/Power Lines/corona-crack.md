# Description
Start 6' up on a flat pedestal (belay here). Climb past 2 hollow but wedged flakes up to the roof, plug in some good gear, and either jam or lie back past the mini roof. Crux moves are short, and give way to good hands, followed by fists to the top. Will definitely turn into a good route with more ascents. Bolted anchor.

# Location
Directly to the right of finger crack of the desert.

# Protection
Single cams from .2- #3. bolted anchor at top
