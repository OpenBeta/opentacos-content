# Description
I don't know the history of this climb.  I just thought I would add it as a separate climb from Hand crack.  It climbs the obvious crack left of hand crack.  The crack is often too wide for jams or fist but there are other features inside the crack or on the face.  Worth doing if you are here!

# Location
Obvious crack left of hand crack, in the same stem box.

# Protection
Trad or top rope
