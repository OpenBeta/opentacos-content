# Description
Start with a dirty scramble up to the base of the flake/crack, move up the flake on good holds and some jams. Reach out on the face pull some moves, mantle and slab to the top.

# Location
To the right of the 3 finger cracks, left trending flake with bolts on the right.

# Protection
4 Bolts. Â This used to be a mixed climb, but with the new sport climbs in the area, and a close call with someone "sport" leading it without the supplementary trad gear, two bolts were added to make this safe to lead without gear.
