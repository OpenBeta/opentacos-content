# Description
Blocky climb with big ledges to an airy final sequence over the bulging arete.  Two great rests.  Maybe a letter grade easier if you move left to the crack/corner and then back to arete at the final bolt.  Definitely a letter grade harder if you are short.  The route was put up pulling straight over the bulge.  The crux is well protected.

# Location
Far left side of the crag, furthest bolted route to left.

# Protection
bolts, chain anchor
