# Description
Starts directly up the arete to a great undercling at the small roof. A small stance is available after turning the roof.  A tricky sequence (crux) leads to a ledge and a more moderate top face.  Well protected.  The chains are hard to get to for TR, so a safety bolt was added under a bush to aid in getting over the edge to the anchors.

# Location
The bolted arete with obvious small roof left of the "Steep Flake" route.

# Protection
bolts and chain anchors
