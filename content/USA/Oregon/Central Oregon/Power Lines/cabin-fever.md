# Description
Delicate balance moves lead to a killer jug on the arete and some sweet edge climbing up to a big ledge before a final short headwall.  Probably 11- for shorter folks.  Stick clip the first bolt if you are not solid at the grade.

# Location
Right side of crag.  Currently the second rightmost route on the wall

# Protection
bolts, chain anchors
