# Description
Three distinct sections; a little OW, a friendly hand crack, and a layback flake. A stiff little crux getting into the hand crack keeps it exciting.

# Location
Next to the broken column on the ground. Starts up a short ramp then a right facing OW corner.

# Protection
2"-5", two bolts on top. A number #5 C4 fits but it can be led safely with a #4.
