# Description
Bouldery, powerful start on good edges leads to a large ledge with a loose boulder. Continue up past a fixed pin to a painful ringlock/rattly finger crack. Pull through a small bulge with smeary feet (crux). Finish on slightly easier ground.

# Location
Left side of crag. Around the corner from the obvious hand crack.

# Protection
A couple 0.5s and a 0.75 green c4.
