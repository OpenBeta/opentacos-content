# Description
Cling On is a three pitch route but most parties only climb the first pitch (5.8).  The crux of the first pitch is making the first few moves to the obvious handholds in the huecos.  Pitch two climbs up (5.9) and then out right on a traverse (5.5)to the first belay of The Snake.  Pitch three (5.9) ascends the upper pitch of The Snake.

# Location
The left-facing book about 70 feet north of Snake Rock in an alcove.

# Protection
Gear to 4 inches if climbing entire route. Gear to 2 inches if only climbing first pitch.
