# Description
This varied route is a first pitch that leads to a 2nd pitch (Lords  of Karma- 12c).  It's however, a very worthwhile jaunt in itself.  It starts with easier pockets leading to a tricky traverse right and  committing moves in the roof section as you move right to better holds(crux).  A roof pull-over leads to easier finishing moves to the anchors.

# Location
