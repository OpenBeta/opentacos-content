# Description
An ultra classic arete with continuous thin technical moves.  Originally climbed  mostly on the right side, easier but still challenging starting moves on the left-center lead to a thin ledge.  From here, the arete and tiny holds provide continuously difficult, technical moves up until just a little ways before the anchors.

# Location
Obvious classic 90 degree arete at the center of the Snake Rock area.  See Snake Rock area description.

# Protection
5 bolts.  Rap Anchors
