# Description
This route is in the shade pretty much all day. Start by making the crux moves off small crimps to the first bolt. Cheater stones are usually stacked to make the reach to the starting holds a bit easier. (Moves off the ground are doable using a small undercling and shallow pocket, your choice) After reaching the starting holds, make a few hard moves to get to the first bolt. After you reach the first bolt, the climbing turns much easier.

# Location
Right of the Cling on Dihedral.

# Protection
Bolts, Chain Anchor, Stick Clip if you want to be protected through the crux.
