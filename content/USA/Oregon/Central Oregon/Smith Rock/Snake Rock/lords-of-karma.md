# Description
This stunning sport line climbs a water streak on widely varying terrain.  It's almost as if someone took a stunning, old school line from Ce√ºse or Verdon and plonked it on the Backside.  This is a stout line, and it will test your head, stamina, and footwork.

After climbing one of more sandbagged 5.10's in Smith, tricky crimping leads to arete where a rest can be found.  A tricky clip and some intense pulling on side pulls and pockets leads to a dash to the next clipping stance.  Rest here and get psyched, if you screw up the sequence pulling on to the slab you'll be clocking some air time!  After a much needed respite, the final two bolts tackle a physical overhang on good holds.

# Location
Above Hemp Liberation

# Protection
13 bolts.  Long sling on the 4th, you shouldn't need to unclip the bolt above the roof as the book says.
