# Description
This relatively short sport climb starts with a funky steep overhanging section before straightening out.  Good holds and rests abound.

# Location
Just to the left of The Golden Road

# Protection
6 bolts to 2 rap hangers (no rings/chains), then 1 more bolt to a chain anchor, so I'd bring 8 draws to get to the chains
