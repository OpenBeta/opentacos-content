# Description
P1 - 8 bolts, Start on knobs in the crack/corner and quickly step right onto the grey slab. Climb passable rock up and right through a slabby crux (5.9). Continue up and right on moderate knobs past a few bolts, to a good foot ledge on the arete, below a large roof.

P2 - 9 bolts, Step right onto the river (northwest) face of Snake Rock. Make fun, moderate moves on a knobby slab, clipping 6 bolts and passing a few ledges to a good rest before the business. The crux bulge is a small hanging dihedral with great exposure in a cool position. Climb a technical sequence on positive holds past 3 bolts, facing clean falls. A series of pockets in vertical stone leads to a comfortable mantle onto the summit. Belay on two offset bolts a few feet back from the edge. There's a rappel station closer to the very top of the feature that drops you directly back to the 1st pitch anchors.

# Location
Approach as for Hemp Liberation. From the trail in front of Snake Rock, you need to scramble uphill and around to the northeast side of the formation. Don't go up the chossy chute just left of the main face. Instead scramble on top of boulders to access a little-used climbers trail that leads up toward Spider Man Buttress. Walk up the trail for 40 feet and look back at the NE face of Snake Rock. The route starts just uphill on a grey-colored slab, with a vertical crack to it's left. Carefully cross some loose talus, and belay on a small platform (6x6, rebar and stone) at the base of the slab. 60 seconds from Hemp Liberation.

# Protection
9  bolts, and bolted anchors. There is a rap station (long chains) at the very summit for a direct descent back to the 1st pitch anchor.
