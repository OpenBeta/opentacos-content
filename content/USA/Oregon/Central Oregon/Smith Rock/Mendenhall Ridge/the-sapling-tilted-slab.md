# Description
This is not at all classsic, but if you've hiked all the way out here to climb the Poplar (as you should) you might as well tick this one off too.  You certainly don't want to have to hike back out here again when you decide your life goals include ticking all of the Smith Rock 5.3s.

The rock on this route is downright bad, so take your time and choose holds wisely.

# Location
This route begins on the uphill side of the Sapling, which is the squat tower immediately down the ridge from the Poplar.  Ascend the slab, then circle around on the big ledge to the down-hill side of the summit tower and scramble up.

# Protection
There is no gear.  You will more or less be soloing.  You could probably rig something at the base of the summit tower, but I doubt it would do much good in a fall.  After downclimbing the summit pinnacle it's possible to rap the tilted slab.
