# Description
The Great Gig in the Sky is the 3rd pitch route sitting above the 2nd pitch route Breathe.

This amazing route climbs through bullet-hard tuff. There are 3 crux sections with the hardest one resting a little past midway on the route. Enjoy this thought provoking technical slab, dancing up and around a distinct column feature that hangs down the route. Work into a shallow corner above the large column. Make the hard exit out of the corner moving left to jug flakes. From the rest, work back right. The route finishes on crimps and is full value climbing up until clipping the chains.

It’s suggested to belay in single pitch fashion from the anchors of Breathe. This route does NOT top out the Picnic Lunch wall.

(The line left of The Great Gig in the Sky is still a closed project. Please do not climb on the fixed draws!)

# Location
This is the 3rd pitch route resting above the 2nd pitch route Breathe.
