# Description
Appian Way has been described as a "cheap 5.12", as the crux of this route is before the first bolt and can be "toproped" as a part of the lead by stick-clipping the first bolt.  The crux involves a series of strenuous overhung layback moves, moving through 3 separate "layback formations" before reaching easier ground.  Knob and pocket moves in the 5.10 range finish the route but may feel harder than this if you have a pump from the crux moves.

# Location
The first bolt line right of

Sharing is Caring

and just right of the crack line No Picnic. Starts immediately in a bulge overhang.

# Protection
Bolts (aprox. 6) and Rap Anchors.
