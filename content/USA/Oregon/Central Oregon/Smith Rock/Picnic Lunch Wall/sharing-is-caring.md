# Description
Sharing is Caring is located on the far right side of the Picnic Lunch Wall at Smith Rock State Park.

P1: 5.10b, 13 bolts. Classic Smith slab nubbin climbing. Climb through a bomber flake section down low leading to perfect Smith nubbin climbing up high . Fun stuff! The route gets easier the higher you go. Fixed steel anchors have been added to the first pitch.

P2: 5.11c 13 bolts. Work up the arete and slab until the route busts right and climbs through the overhang on jugs. Pulling the lip is probably the hardest move.

P3: 5.11a 11 bolts. Fixed anchors. Start on out the flake that is shared with Teddy Bear’s Picnic. Once established onto the slab, keep working up and right staying on course of Sharing is Caring. Work up the insecure slab to the fun dihedral section. The rock is slick up there!!

Belay both climbers up to the 2nd pitch anchors and belay for the 3rd pitch in single pitch fashion. Both climbers get to lead the 3rd pitch and won’t end up crammed up in that small corner at the 3rd pitch anchors. 3 raps to get down.

# Location
Located to the right of the Honey Pot on the Picnic Lunch Wall.

# Protection
Bolts. Quicklinks at all 3 rap stations and fixed anchors at the 3rd pitch anchor station.
