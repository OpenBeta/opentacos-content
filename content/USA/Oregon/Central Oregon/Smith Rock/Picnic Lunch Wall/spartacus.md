# Description
Spartacus is a quality route, with sustained difficulty and mostly excellent rock.  Begin with an unusual move to a large fang.  Undercling the fang and move left to a good sloper.  Mantle the subtle ledge, then up to killer knobs under the shallow roof.  Moving past this roof & the third bolt is the crux.  A pair of good edges up & left lead to a vertical slot in a shallow seam, and a few more tenous moves to get established above the roof.

Once above the roof, continue up rounded flakes & quintessential Smith knobs, past a few large pockets towards the top of the wall.  The rock deteriorates substantially near the top.  Several fractured blocks guard the finishing mantle.

# Location
Immediately right of Appian Way, and the next route left of La Siesta.

# Protection
Bolts.  Stick clip recommended.  The 2-bolt anchor is high and to the right of the climb.
