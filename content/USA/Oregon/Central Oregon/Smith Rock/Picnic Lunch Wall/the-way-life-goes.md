# Description
A separate 5 bolt intro that joins into Coleslaw and Chemicals for the cruxy final 3 bolts. Whereas Coleslaw has a moderate intro to the hard climbing above, The Way Life Goes has difficulties that begin from the first move. Expect fun (subjective) bouldery moves between generally decent holds and insecure feet around the 4th/5th bolt crux. The start checks in around 12+/13- with the tricky red point crux still waiting above at the last bolt.

# Location
Begin 10 feet right of the obvious chalky horizontal seams of Coleslaw and Chemicals.

# Protection
5 bolts for the start, 8 bolts total
