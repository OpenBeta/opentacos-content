# Description
General description not given

# Location
The route begins left of center at the base of the tallest section of the Picnic Lunch wall. A right-leaning seam with banged out peg holes and a roof at about 10 feet marks the start. From the top of pitch 5, scramble right and up for a 4th/5th class exposed gully finish. Decend down the Misery Ridge Trail.

# Protection
The pin scars eat nuts like a...squirrel? At a minimum take a set of nuts and double up on the medium sizes. Doubles of cams from tips to hand size, one big hands size cam. Many draws and many slings. A 60 meter rope works perfect but some back- clipping is required should you need to rap and bail. Worst case scenario you can fix a single 60m and retreat from the top of pitch 2 rapping the single line.
