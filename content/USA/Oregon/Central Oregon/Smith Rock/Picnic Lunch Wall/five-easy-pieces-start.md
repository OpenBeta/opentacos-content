# Description
The whole line is pretty sustained the whole way through. The physical crux comes low with a throw to a huge bucket. Technical demands remain high though as the top half turns to balancey, crimpy moves. Anchors seem hard to clip for shorter folk, but if you made it to the top you'll figure it out.

# Location
Pretty much on the right side of Picnic Lunch wall. It's right in front of the trail that leads up misery ridge.

# Protection
7 bolts
