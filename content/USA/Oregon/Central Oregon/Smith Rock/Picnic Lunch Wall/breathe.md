# Description
This second pitch line is the access route leading up to The Great Gig in the Sky. From the ground, start out climbing the first pitch of Sharing is Caring. When you reach the first pitch anchors, mantel the easy ledge and traverse right on the big ledge system leading to the start of Breathe.

Enjoy the tight bolt spacing while working up this friction slab. Crimps and bigger holds seem to appear when needed. The crux of the route seems to come about 3/4 of the way up, followed by the redpoint crux immediately after.

Rappel down to the ground from the belay station atÂ the start of Breathe. 60m gets you down.

# Location
Located above the 1st pitch of Sharing is Caring. Traverse right at the 1st pitch anchors of Sharing is Caring and arrive at the belay station for Breathe.

# Protection
11 bolts, fixed steel chains. Fixed chains at the belay station as well.
