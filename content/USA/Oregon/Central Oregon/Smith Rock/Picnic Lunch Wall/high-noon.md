# Description
Start to the right of the bolt line and climb up big holds to the first bolt. At the first bolt traverse left through a somewhat tricky second clip to the base of the half-moon feature where you can get a good rest. From here the climbing gradually increases in difficulty through the next three bolts culminating in a very cool, very thin, crimper crux. Dope!
