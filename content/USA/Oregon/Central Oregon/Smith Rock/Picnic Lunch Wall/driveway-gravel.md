# Description
This fine 3 pitch route tops out on the right side of the Picnic Lunch Wall. Most people stop after the first pitch but the increasingly difficult 2nd and 3rd pitches make for a very enjoyable outing.

Start as for Highway 97:

P1:

5.11b Pockets and knobs up a bolted face. Alternatively, you can start on

La Siesta

(5.11d) for a slightly more challenging first pitch.

P2:

5.11d More edging and pockets lead up to a final runout traverse.

Now you're into the actual D.G. pitch:

P3:

5.12c The crux pitch-- climb up the steep final face on a series of very thin pockets.

# Location
The far right side of the Picnic Lunch Wall.

# Protection
Quickdraws, 60m rope for rappelling.
