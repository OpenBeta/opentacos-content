# Description
This route is really fun and unique for Smith, featuring both slopers and xenoliths.  The first three bolts feature some surprisingly long moves between sloping holds.  The whole middle part of the route travels through relatively easy juggy terrain.  The first six bolts probably rate in around 11d.

Immediately after clipping the sixth bolt the climbing gets increasingly harder.  The last nubbiny crux is probably around V6/7.  The difficulty continues all the way to the very last move.  Hope you're good at pinching/underclinging/mantling nubbins.
