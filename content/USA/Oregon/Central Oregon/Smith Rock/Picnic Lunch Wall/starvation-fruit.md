# Description
Hard and very sustained! This route is a power endurance nightmare. Start on The Big R, but move right after the no hands rest about 40' up. From here, pull through a gnarly v8 to another v8 to get an ok rest crimp. Pull through sustained v7 movement and throw to a gastundercling at the mini roof. Sketch through 5.12+ climbimg to get to the same anchor as The Big R. Very high in the grade, especially after feet have broked.

# Location
Same start as The Big R. Look for a gently overhanging route that angles right after a mini overlap roof. Use a 70m rope to lower down.

# Protection
Bolts
