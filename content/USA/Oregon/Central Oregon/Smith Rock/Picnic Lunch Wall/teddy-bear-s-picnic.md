Maybe three stars...

This fine route just keeps getting better as you go.

Climb through huge huecos to a bolt just left of the 1st bolt on Honey Pot. Follow the thin slabby face above on little knobs. to an anchor.

5.10c 100'

Pitch 2: Move up and right through some choss to a clean face above. Follow bolts to a cruxy move just below a ledge with an anchor.

5.10 55'

Pitch 3: Move right on beautiful red stone and follow the edge with a lot of air below your feet until you hit the arete and go straight following bolts to an anchor. The anchor is just above a huge partially detached flake/block that should be negotiated with care.

5.10b 60' (can easily be combined with pitch 2)

Rap the route in two single rope rappels.
