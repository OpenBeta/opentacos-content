# Description
Start up a layback on jugs with bad feet. Then, thug up a severe 20' long boulder problem. Very technical and balancey. Bad footholds, and sideways handholds. Very crimpy.

# Location
Right under the anchor to Midnight Snack. Just to the right of the large 25' tall flake.

# Protection
Quickdraws. Not fixed
