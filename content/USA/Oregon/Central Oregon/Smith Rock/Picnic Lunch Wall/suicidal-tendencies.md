# Description
Although this route garners a single star in the Watts guidebook, I found the climbing to be sustained and mentally scintillating on good to excellent rock. The crux entails unorthodox moves over a small roof half way to the top but there are many difficult sections beginning off the ground. Reaching the anchors requires climbing over a second small roof (10+) about 10' above the last bolt. A fall would be undesirable at this point.

# Location
The route begins on the far left side of the Picnic Lunch Wall.

# Protection
Quick draws for 10 bolts to rappel anchors. A stopper placement may be possible at the final roof. Stick clipping the first bolt is recommended.
