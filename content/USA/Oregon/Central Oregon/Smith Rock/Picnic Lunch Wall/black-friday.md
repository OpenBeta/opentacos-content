# Description
Very strange, bouldery route. The crux has a very hard v9ish sequence on tiny crimps. Has funky, cool movement up to a jug right before the crux. And a heartbreaker right before the finish. I probably sandbagged this one.... it's pretty hard for 5.13d.

# Location
Starts just to the left of Coleslaw and Chemicals, and ends on the same finish/last couple bolts,

# Protection
Bring quickdraws
