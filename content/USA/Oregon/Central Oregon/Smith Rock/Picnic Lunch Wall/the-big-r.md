# Description
Super awesome route. Starts on 5.12 up until a no hands rest. Pull through some big moves on flat edges to gain a left facing plate. Pull through a burly v8 sequence to get a left facing arÃªte. More 5.12 to the top slab (vertical). From here, navigate through a minefield of tiny edges on perfect rock. High in the grade.

# Location
On Picnic Lunch Wall. Look for a vertical wall into a gently overhanging one with red rock on top. Has a sister route that splits off and rejoins at the anchor

# Protection
Bolts
