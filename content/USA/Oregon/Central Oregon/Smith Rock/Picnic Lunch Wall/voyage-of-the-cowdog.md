# Description
Pitch one starts at the top of the gully separating the table scraps wall from ship rock.  Climb an easy slab that wanders right into a steepening water groove and exit onto the ridge through a shallow chimney (5.8).  Pitch two consists of basically moving the belay 60' up the scenic ridge to the base of the final pitch (5.5).  Pitch three is the money pitch that justifies the mediocre 1st and 2nd pitch.  Climb the airy slab through several steep bulges to a crux high step with entire height of the Picnic lunch wall beneath you (5.8).

# Location
This route is located between table scraps wall and ship rock at the top of the gully. Hike up past the shipwreck wall until a faint trail takes off right, under the table scraps wall and then switchbacks up the gully, please try to find this path as the hillside is fragile. Walk off(adventurous/reccomended) to the misery ridge trail or rap the route(difficult) with at least a 60m rope that will BARELY make it down to the base of the third pitch and barely make down to the ground on the first pitch(use knots at the end of the rope).  Rapping down the shallow gulley climbers left seems to be the best on the second pitch.  This was one of the last routes to make the new guide book and it was quickly rated with only a few ascents before the new book went to print, therefore it got rated harder than it is. That being said, this is not your average 5.8 Smith sport route with manicured rock, avoid if loose rock bothers you...
