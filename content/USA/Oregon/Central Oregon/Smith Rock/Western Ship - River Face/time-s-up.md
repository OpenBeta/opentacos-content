# Description
An opening violent move cedes to a thirty foot 5.7 solo (could place a hand sized piece with a 48" runner, I think.  A fall from this could ground you from fifty feet.).  Atop this little wall, clip in, sit, and get psyched for the upper wall, which has some great movement.

The crimps for hands are satisfyingly small, and the multitude of small, but sharp, footholds allow artistry.  I would not be surprised to see ten different people climb this ten different ways.

# Location
Starts on the same moves as Slit Your Wrist, but escapes right and up the from-the-ground-obvious 5.7 big hands crack/layback.  Then balance and crimp your way through the headwall.  Hai-yah!

# Protection
Draws, currently in situ.  Watch out, these babies have seen some weather.
