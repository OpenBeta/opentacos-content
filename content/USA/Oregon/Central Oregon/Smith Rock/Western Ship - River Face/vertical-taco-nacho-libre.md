# Description
A short lower-grade sport route. The rock isn't super confidence inspiring right now, and the moves are just ok, but it's a good one to set up for your new climber friends when Night Flight and Easy Reader are busy.

# Location
Between Phone Call from Satan and Purple Headed Warrior.

# Protection
4 bolts, 2-bolt anchor with chains
