# Description
Great new route to the left of Caffeine Free. Starts with a sweet lie back pinch, into an even better lie back, then some sweet Â "Smith nubbin" face climbing and jugs to the top. Protected well and possibly the best intermediate route on the wall!

Sierra here: it is actually called COVID 5.10. (since cover is '19', I was just playing with numbers). it went up 4/20. Casey did try and save a nice hold down low but adding epoxy, but our guess is that it will break sooner or later.

# Location
Immediately to the left of Caffeine Free

# Protection
Sport - 8 bolts
