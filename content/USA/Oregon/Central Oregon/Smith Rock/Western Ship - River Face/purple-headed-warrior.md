# Description
Purple Headed Warrior is the rightmost route on the river face.  It climbs a bolted face separated from the other river wall routes by a small, broken gully.  PHW is a very moderate warm up, or a nice intro lead.  Pleasant pebble pinching moves on a fine example of Smith's welded tuff bring you to the anchor.
