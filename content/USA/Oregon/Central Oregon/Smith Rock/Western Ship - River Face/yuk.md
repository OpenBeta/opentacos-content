# Description
Begin on the recently rebuilt, luxury ledge. Complete with heated leather belay seats and lowering kit, the first bolt lies just a few feet higher than it once did.

From the ground, warm up with the initial 5.11+ / V12 boulder problem (generally considered to be the crux) to a stance at the 4th bolt.

After resting here for 30-40 minutes, cut left and slap your way through the entire crux sequence of Slit Your Wrist.

If you manage to make it to the 7th bolt without slicing your groin open on the arete, you've finally reached the base of Mr. Yuk, which lies on the headwall to your right. Better than it sounds and just as good as it looks, progressively difficult boulder problems separate each bolt all the way to a crux at the 11th. Be sure to chalk a few footholds to confuse the next guy before climbing the last few bolts to a fixed anchor.

# Location
Center of the headwall between Times Up and The Blade.

# Protection
13 Bolts + A fixed anchor
