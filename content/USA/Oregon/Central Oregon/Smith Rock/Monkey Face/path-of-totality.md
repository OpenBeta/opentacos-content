# Description
Charlie and I climbed this route during the totality of the 2017 eclipse.  It was an exciting venture and an exciting route (really it's just a long and exposed boulder problem several hundred feet off the deck).

Start a little left of the middle of the cave and climb out the overhang, doing gymnastic moves and some campusing while veering rightward.

I placed two cams in a rotten horizontal shelf about 10 feet into the climb.  If these blow you will take a factor two fall, your rope tightening over the 90 degree lip of the cave.  This would be very bad and I think the climb deserves an R/X rating (I bounced tested the placements before I lead the route and they held.  They might hold a lead fall).

After this do a really spectacular move that involves an undercling jug, a heal hook, and a little crimper fin.  So neat!

Then stay calm, move even higher above those cams, do a nifty reach out right, sling the natural handle bar, and say yippee! phew! thank goodness!  Then change your diaper.

# Location
The route comes out of the middle of the Monkey's mouth and ends left of the nose.

# Protection
Two equalized cams (#4, #5 Metolius), one Metolius sling for a natural handle bar, a Pampers diaper.
