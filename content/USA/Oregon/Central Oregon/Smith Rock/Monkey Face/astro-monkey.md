# Description
Pitch 1: Sustained difficult face climbing on thin edges past three bolts gains a very thin crack and 1 more bolt to a small roof. Above the roof easy climbing leads to a two bolt anchor (11d).

Pitch 2: A steep finger crack for 12' leads to lower angle climbing and an anchor at the base of a left facing and slanting dihedral (5.9).

Pitch 3: Sustained 5.10 climbing in the dihedral (some fixed gear) leads to a bolt above a roof. Pull the roof (11a) and belay on a small ledge.

Pitch 4: This short pitch goes up a dihedral and right around a small roof to a large ledge (Bohn Street) (10-).

Pitch 5 and 6: Finish on Monkey Space (5.11).

# Location
This route begins at the base of the west side of the Monkey. Rappel down the east face of the Monkey from the summitt.

# Protection
