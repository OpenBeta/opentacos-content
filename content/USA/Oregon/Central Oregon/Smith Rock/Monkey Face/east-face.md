# Description
This route also goes free at 5.13d!

P1 - C2 or 5.12c - Aid or free the crack to a sling belay this pitch eats nuts.

P2 - C2 or 5.13d - Aid the crack up past 4 bolts (replaced by Alan Watts on his free attempt). Belay from 2 brand new bolts.

P3 - 5.6 C1 or 5.10b - Aid up the bolt ladder past one old belay to a slab to the summit. Many old bolts on this pitch.

P1 & P2 link with 60m rope. This takes more gear so you might want to back clean a little.

# Location
the only crack on the east face

# Protection
clean rack to 2" heavy on the nuts
