# Description
This variation on the Pioneer route provides the finest moderate route to the Monkey's Summit.  It adds several great pitches and about another 100ft of climbing to the standard route.

Pitch 1:  Begin on the right side of the west face of Monkey Face.  Begin in a short section of flaring chimney or just to the right of this chimney on a small crack on the face.  Move up these harder opening moves onto easier cracks. Continue up through a dihedral with a few bolts and a few mini roofs to a stance and a bolted anchor just below a 4th class ramp.  This pitch is fairly long.

Pitch 2:  Climb the slotted ramp above to a steep large roof.  There are several variations here but the easiest is follow a crack out the right side of the roof.  Pull around the roof on the right side and you'll see the anchors.

Pitch 3:  Traverse left on a slab protecting in a thin crack on the wall in fron of you.  From here head toward the notch formed between the monkey and the main buttress.  Continue up the slab on the Pioneer route to the anchor below red rock and the aid pitch.
