# Description
Wonderful splitter finger crack into perfect/cupped hands with thought provoking moves - some bad rock (protected by a bolt) as is to be expected for Smith trad. Guidebook gives it an R but the natural line is directly up the west face variation and most certainly not an R as that is attributable to a weird traverse the FA did going hard left at the very end on 5.7 terrain. Go straight up the crack system instead. This line has PG gear and intriguing balancy crack climbing.

Link this route straight into to West Face variation (anchors directly above) and then Monkey Space or Pioneers if you want to ascend to the top.

# Location
Directly right of West Face Variation start.

# Protection
1 bolt - single rack to #3
