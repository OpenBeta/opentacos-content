# Description
The leftmost line on the East Face, Rising Expectations features splitter tips and fingers on beautiful, overhanging rock.  A brief section of tips gives way to fun plugging and chugging through the meat of the line.  The last move is a potential heart-breaker.  You've been warned...

# Location
Left of Just Do It on the East Face of the Monkey.
