# Description
This stellar crack system is one of the best routes on the Monkey, and easily the best crack of its grade at Smith.  The crux crack pitch can be climbed in two pitches, but is much more classic and challenging as one mega pitch.  Be sure to use a 60m rope for this option.

Considered by many to be 12b, the crux pitch requires a multitude of skills and abilities, not the least of which is the ability to place gear while pumped.  The final traverse in to the West Face Cave will feel pretty desperate with 50m of rope hanging from your harness.

# Location
North Face of the Monkey.  Approach via Misery Ridge, and traverse the 5.6 choss band below Spank the Monkey.

# Protection
At least 12 draws, and all the finger-sized cams you can scrounge.  The crack takes nuts as well, if you want to pump out fiddling with gear.
