# Description
Who hasn't walked past this clean, striking arete? The Product is remarkable in many regards. It and its neighboring route seem to have take all of the solid rock in the area and combined it into two bullet hard features.

From afar, The Product looks perfect, but up close, you can see its namesake; glue. The beginning is covered in it, but don't let that distract you. The next 16 bolts feature a wide variety of delicate face climbing, bewildering arete movement, and creative resting zones. The crescendo is a powerful left to right sequence across the obvious finishing crack system.

# Location
Left arete of the Juniper Spire.

# Protection
19 bolts
