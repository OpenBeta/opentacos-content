# Description
While its not the most inspiring line to look at, it is a really fun route. Start off on an easy 5.10 sequence that leads to a couple bolts of 5.8 climbing. Once you reach the end of an obvious flake, the climbing starts to be more cerebral, then physical as you reach the overhang. A good amount of bolts and good rock where it counts make this route easy to enjoy. The 5.12 crux at the top is well worth the journey.

# Location
Start off on the edge of the 5.8 buckets. The starting move is more like 5.10 and the overhang above is obvious. Look for the short set of anchors with no extension.

# Protection
bolts. Steel carabiners at the anchors
