# Description
Capacity Tenacity is located near the center of the Puddy's Tower Wall in the The Monument area at Smith Rock. The route climbs to the right of the large 'cheater stone'.

Start with a couple bouldery moves to the first bolt, then climb right underclinging the small roof. Move around the roof to start laybacking the crack until reaching the sixth bolt. After clipping the sixth bolt take advantage of the rest jugs. Immediately after clipping the seventh bolt move left onto the face and meet the first crux of the climb. Bump left on the small crimps and keep your feet on the wall! After making it past the first crux enjoy a nice rest jug and climb out left again into a double gaston redpoint crux. Clip the tenth bolt and enjoy a no hands rest. Climb right through some desperate reachy moves and finish the climb on a semi-chossy slab.
