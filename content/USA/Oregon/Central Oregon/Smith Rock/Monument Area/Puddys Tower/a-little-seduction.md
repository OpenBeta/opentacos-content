# Description
This four bolt beauty is unlike any other at Smith, for the wall is of polished tuff. The wall itself is completely smooth and incredibly hard to smear on.

The climbing starts out on good holds and then you're immediately hit with a mini crux about 10' up on small holds (Stick clip suggested).. A finicky traverse left gets you to the jug for a full rest. Ride the diagonal crack system of good holds up and right while walking your feet up the small horizontal cracks.

The crux is located between bolt 2 and 3, while riding seemingly far out right, you immediately traverse back left to clip on good holds.

After a good shake, climb to bolt 4 on small holds and deal with a potential tough clip (helps to be taller). After bolt 4, keep climbing through the redpoint crux to the anchors.

# Location
Right side base of Puddy's Tower

# Protection
4 bolts, anchors.
