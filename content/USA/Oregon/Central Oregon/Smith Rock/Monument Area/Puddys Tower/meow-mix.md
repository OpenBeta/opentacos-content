# Description
The pitch continuing above Kibbles 'n Bits. Step around the roof and face a brief crux, then a hard traverse leftward and follow good edges up to the anchor.

For the Full Meow Mix experience, continue past the anchor for 2 more bolts on a vertical wall with sparse holds. 100 feet, 5.12c/d. This is the shared finish with the direct line, The Next Episode.

# Location
Passes the right side of the square-cut roof

# Protection
13 bolts. One of the upper bolts sits on a slab and should have an extended draw to keep the rope running clean.
