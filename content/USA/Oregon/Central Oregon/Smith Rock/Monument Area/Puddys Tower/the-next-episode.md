# Description
Start off on the left of the two 5.8 routes and continues past the first set of anchors. Work some magic to find a sequence to get established on the overhang, and fight the pump through these stacked cruxes. Don't forget the finale above the 2nd anchor, another hard 5.12 crux guards the finish.

# Location
Climbs through the juggy left slab route past an anchor in a ceiling.

# Protection
All bolts. Fixed steel on anchors
