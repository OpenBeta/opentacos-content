# Description
This route would be decent for a new trad climber as the rock is pretty good for Victoria tower. The actual climbing is no more than 20 feet. The feet and hands are excellent. No crack technique is needed and you get gear whenever you want. The finish is literally walking up a 3rd class ramp to the anchor. There is some loose rock on the ramp so be careful not to rain on your belayer.

# Location
20’ right of Oh Oh Climax. Pass through a small corridor between the wall and a large boulder to a right facing dihedral That’s kinda hidden from view.

# Protection
Gear to 3”. Sport anchor w/ quick links.
