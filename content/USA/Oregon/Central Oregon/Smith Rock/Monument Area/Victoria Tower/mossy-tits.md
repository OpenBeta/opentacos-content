# Description
Good 5.8 climbing that leads to an overhanging wall of pockets to pull.  Options on the overhang are limitless, though some pockets are better than others.

A well bolted route and worth climbing if in the area.  It's a shame the overhanging section isn't longer.

# Location
Just to the right of The Safe Zone.  Look for a series of bolts that climbs up and past a very large hueco and leads into an overhanging honeycomb like section at the top near the anchor.

# Protection
8 bolts.  2 bolt anchor with rap rings.
