# Description
Just about as pleasant and inviting as a 6$ bottle of wine from TJ's. Crux midway up, traverse left under a large crack, (you can place a #3 here if you want, but it's absolutely not needed) then pull up onto the pedestal to finish

# Location
Left most route at the crag.

# Protection
Bolts
