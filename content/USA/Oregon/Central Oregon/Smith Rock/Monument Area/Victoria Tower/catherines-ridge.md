# Description
Easy climbing on less than stellar rock. Route finding is a little adventurous but not advanced.

Pitch 1:

From the bolt, shoot up the dihedral on gear till you top the little spire. Rap down the notch and walk over to the far side of said notch. Anchor.

Pitch 2: Move up and around to the north side following a couple bolts. Scramble up the Choss pile till you summit! Sick Bra!!

If you can tolerate the poor rock, this climb is alpine style fun.

# Location
Hike up the north gully until you reach the backside of the formation, then head slightly down the south gully until you get to a ledge with a bolt on it to your left. Expect to see the ledge very quickly when headed downhill.

# Protection
Mixed to 4”. Two rope rap from final anchors down the south side or reverse the route with one.
