# Description
All Dogs go to Heaven is located to the left of The Hank Collins Memorial Route on The Hank Collins Memorial Wall. This route climbs from almost ground floor all the way to the second pitch anchors of The Hank Spire. An 80m rope is required to ascend and safely lower to the ground!

Start out on good holds up to the first bolt. After clipping the second bolt, the route is pretty much on. Follow a meandering path up working far left then back right and up. Powerful yet technical climbing up to bolt 5 leads to the lower crux on the face. Clear the hard face and bust right through the obvious weakness in the rock. Follow the good holds up into the dihedral and work onto the ledge arriving at the anchor station for The Hank Spire. From here, start to work up the easy terrain through the traverse. After traversing left, workÂ right and up through the overhanging sections above. Clear the three pumpy sections of climbing and arrive at the anchors of All Dogs go to Heaven.

# Location
Starts to the left of The Hank Collins Memorial Route, partway up the ramp.

# Protection
21 bolts, fixed steel anchors
