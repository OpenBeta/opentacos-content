# Description
Teasing Hank is link-up of the first 10 bolts of A Big Tease into the last 4 bolts of the Hank Collins Memorial Route.

Start as for A Big Tease working up the moderate face to the bottom of the crack. Enter into the crack of good holds and finger locks, clip the long fixed draw, and make the committing run to the jug over the roof. After clipping the second fixed draw, follow the diagonal traverse left to a good rest at bolt 10. (Extending this draw and the first you come to as you traverse left from here into the other route is very helpful.)

After clipping bolt 10 on A Big Tease, move left then up clipping the last 4 bolts and anchors of the Hank Collins Memorial Route. Expect more committing climbing, generous bolt spacing, and a few cruxy moves moving past the last bolt.

# Location
Start is the same as for A Big Tease

# Protection
14 Bolts (two are fixed) with steel clippable anchors on top.
