# Description
The Hank Collins Memorial Route rides straight up the most eye-catching feature on the wall. The beginning of the route starts on grey rock that is deceivingly solid. Big moves off small crimps lead to a prominent S-shaped dihedral followed by a scooping roof. Here is where the wall begins to be smooth as marble in most places. Work your way through the fun and cruiser moves of the dihedral and begin the 2 crux's, one after the other! Powerful moves and steep terrain lead to a technical slab crux. Although the roof and following slab moves are the hardest individual moves on the route, don't let your guard down on the imposing headwall. Spaced bolts and big moves make this an all around demanding line to the anchors: powerful, technical, and sporty!

# Location
Furthest left route before the slab starts. Traverse off the highest terrace where the slab begins.

# Protection
12 bolts with fixed anchors
