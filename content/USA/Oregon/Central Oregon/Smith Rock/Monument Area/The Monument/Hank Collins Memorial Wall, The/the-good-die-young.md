# Description
Start off by climbing in a short dihedral to the first bolt. Then climb the juggy overhanging flake to find yourself under the crimpy crux. The crux features 10 ft of 5/5 star climbing but the short nature of the climb takes away from the overall aesthetics of the climb. Definitely a worthwhile climb.

# Location
Furthest right route on Hank's wall. High first bolt with a close second bolt.

# Protection
4 bolts. Anchors are pre-hung with steel carabiners.
