# Description
One of the steeper routes at Smith begins with the same start as Sweet as Hank, Â climbing up the near vertical slab to the base of the overhang. Go clip the last bolt on the slab on the right and begin up good holds on the steep overhang. This short overhang serves a quick pump and one of the most heartbreaking finishes in the park. You can almost smell the steel of the chains at the final crux!

# Location
Starts of the most left route on the wall, starting up high off the ramp. At the top of the slab, follow the right bolt line.

# Protection
Fixed anchors with steel carabiners. Fixed draws most of the time
