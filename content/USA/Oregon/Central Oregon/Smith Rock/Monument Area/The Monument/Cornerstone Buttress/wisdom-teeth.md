# Description
The right-most climb on the Cornerstone ascends a slab, face, and crack, ending on a ledge. Climb the middle of the pocketed slab for two bolts to a head wall. Clip another bolt above you and negotiate the tricky crux at the start of the

left-facing zig-zag feature. Clip the next few bolts past tricky climbing while the pump builds, before reaching a good jug rest mid climb. End with bomber finger locks and then an easy, flaring crack that has some unique inclusions.

# Location
The furthest right climb on the Cornerstone buttress. Begin by rocking into the middle of the featured slab using pockets.

# Protection
7 bolts

and chain anchors. Helmets work.
