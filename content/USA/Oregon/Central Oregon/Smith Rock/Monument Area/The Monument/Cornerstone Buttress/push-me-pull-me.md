# Description
This excellent climb ascends the center of Cornerstone Buttress’ downhill face. It’s a fun and varied sport climb worthy of traffic. Several distinct cruxes make this an interesting and engaging climb.

Clip the first bolt and find your way carefully to the second. Pass some solid pocketed terrain to the blunt arete. Work out some long moves to good holds to get to the slab above where you can take a rest before the climb goes slightly over-vertical. Make some fun, interesting, and slightly tricky movement past several bolts to a final

heart-breaker

stem and layback sequence. Find a jug stance to the right of the anchors and clip them on your left.

Not super

straight forward beta, or climbing, with several sequences that can be botched. A little of everything!

# Location
Starts on some orange ledges that protrude from flakey grey rock on almost vertical terrain. Just right of the red-tagged route.

# Protection
9 bolts and steel carabiner anchors. Helmet suggested for all climbing.
