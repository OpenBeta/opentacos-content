# Description
Pull onto the hueco covered slab using small pockets, and climb just to the right of the bulge On low-angle terrain. Once the route gets vertical, use good finger locks and face holds to get into the crux, a super fun and interesting boulder problem that uses high feet and a prominent right hand side pull and a poor left hand dish.

The cruxÂ is somewhat height dependent. Find high feet and make a long move leftward to a good jug. Take a rest and climb your way past a few more bolts to a tricky and reachy ending before traversing slightly right just under the anchors. Clip the chains with hands on the ledge below.

# Location
Look for the rounded offset bulge near the middle of the face. The first bolt is just to the right of that feature.

# Protection
7 bolts and chain anchors. Wear a brain bucket.
