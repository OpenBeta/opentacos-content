# Description
Direct Drive is an optional, harder start to the multi pitch route, Star Driven.   It links smoothly with the second pitch, or makes a decent single pitch route.

Forty five feet of 5.9 on crappy rock leads to a steep corner of increasing difficulty on solid, varnished rock.

# Location
Hike and scramble up the main gully between the Monument and Anglin's Buttress for five minutes.  Look for the 50 foot flake of Trailblazer.

Approach Direct Drive by traversing left on the next ledge system below the big ledge where Trailblazer and Star Driven start.

# Protection
Approx. 12 bolts
