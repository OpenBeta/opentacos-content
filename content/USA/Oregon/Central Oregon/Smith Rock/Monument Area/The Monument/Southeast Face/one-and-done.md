# Description
One and Done is the single pitch, cragging variation of the first pitch of Star Driven.  It starts on the left side of the big ledge below the Trailblazer flake.

20 feet of crappy slab climbing leads to a powerful move entering a corner of impeccable rock.   At an intersection at 75 feet where Star Driven exits left, continue up and right-ish, then weave around another 35 feet to a final crux just below the anchor.   Lower off with

70m

rope.

# Location
Hike up the gully between the Monument and Anglin's Buttress for five minutes and look for a big ledge below the 50 foot tall flake of Trailblazer.  One and done follows a line of bolts leading left from the far left side of the ledge.

# Protection
15 bolts

70 meter rope

runners
