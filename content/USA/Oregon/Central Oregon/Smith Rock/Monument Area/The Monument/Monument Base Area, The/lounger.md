# Description
This route is a good choice for beginning leaders. The hardest move pulls off the ground and launches into a plethora of holes and ledges all the way to the anchors. Even though it is easy climbing, the ledges that make it easy also make falls bad.

# Location
This is the left most route on the massive wall of huecos. It is also the first pitch of Abraxas.

# Protection
4 bolts. anchors are way to the right of the fourth bolt.
