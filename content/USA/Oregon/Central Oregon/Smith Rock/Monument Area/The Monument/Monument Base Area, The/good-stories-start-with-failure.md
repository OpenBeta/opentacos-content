# Description
Good Stories Start with Failure starts out climbing with a low first bolt. Climb up through the good chalked holds to a no hands rest. From the no hands, enter into the first crux of the route on a slightly overhanging bulge feature starting on jugs. Working through the crux, set up to stab to a good clipping hold above. Make the clip and climb through another little section before entering another no hands rest. From the second no hands rest, enter into the second crux of the route. Make the next airy clip on jugs and then keep working up on smeary feet and good hand holds to the anchors. The final sequence on this route is flat out fun!

# Location
Good Stories Start with Failure is located to the right of Castles Made in Sand. It’s the furthest line right that ascends the huge flake.

# Protection
10 bolts, soon to be fixed anchors.
