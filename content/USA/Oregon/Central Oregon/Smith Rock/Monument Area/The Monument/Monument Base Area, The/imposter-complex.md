# Description
A general romp up through bucket pockets leads you to the first crux around a bulge where a huge rock was pried out to uncover a shelf you could fit a small library. Continue to the right side of the seam as you enter the abundantly bolted, slightly overhung terrain with a series of side pulls until it eases back into pistol grip pockets to the anchor.
