# Description
SOLO. While this route never puts you way out in space. It does have ankle breaking consequences at certain spots if you fall. There are anchors at the top so if you have at least one confident climber in your party, they can solo and bring you up on rope. This is a great easy “alpine” style adventure.

Hike along the north ridge buttress staying on the 3rd class ridge until a headwall stops the hiking. Follow good pockets and good feet on solid rock  until you reach a ledge with anchor. From here it’s 2nd class to the summit.

This is a great rest day summit as Alan Watts states in his book. It’s super chill even though it looks a little intimidating from the base of the backside ridge.

# Location
Hike the left gully of the monument to the top backside with an obvious sharp ridge line going to the summit.

# Protection
This route is recommended as a solo although you might be able to get some med to large gear at a couple points. Rap anchor or TR anchor at top. Descend by rapping the route or down climb the North Ridge chimney on the west side of the summit, then hike north along ledges back to the ridge line and trail.
