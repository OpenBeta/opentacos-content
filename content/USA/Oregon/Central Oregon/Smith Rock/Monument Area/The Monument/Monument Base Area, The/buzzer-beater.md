# Description
Buzzer Beater is a fully bolted route with two pitches of high quality and varied action, followed by an exposed and scrappy, optional third pitch.

P1. 5.10c***  "Regulation Play".  Easy huecos give way to techy moves on ragged rock followed by a few crack jams on better rock.  105 ft.

P2. 5.10c****  "Crunch Time".  A bouldery start leads to crack moves on the best pitch of the route.  55 ft.

P3. 5.11a**  "Overtime".  Avoid the huge flake/ nest by stepping right to a grungy corner.  Above the flake, make a crux step left to better rock on an exposed face to a finish in an alcove.  110 ft.

Strategy

The ledge atop the first pitch is the only comfortable belay on the route.  If climbing the first two pitches only, it's recommended to link them, then lower to the top of the first pitch with a

70 meter rope.

If climbing the third pitch, either link it with the second, or belay at a chainless, 2-bolt anchor to the right of the chains atop the second pitch.

# Location
Furthest left route at the base of the Monument.  Just right of Cornerstone Buttress.

# Protection
+/- 13 draws for the first pitch

+/- 21 draws to link the first two pitches

70 meter rope
