# Description
Great high steps, side pulls, pockets, and jugs dot this route from bottom to top. Crux is midway up but it is more sustained than cruxy. I wish this route continued all the way to the tombstone wall.

# Location
Starts at the same bolt as Praying mantle and moves right afterwords.

# Protection
7 bolts. Anchors
