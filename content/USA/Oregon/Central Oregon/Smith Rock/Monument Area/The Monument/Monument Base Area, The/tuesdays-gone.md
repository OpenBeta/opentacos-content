# Description
Tuesday’s Gone is located between The Tutorial and Castles Made of Sand. Start out climbing on the jug system starting to the left side of the first bolt. The rail traverses right and up on good holds. Work under the first roof feature. A couple bouldery moves gets you up onto the ramp above. Climb the slabby ramp to a no hands ledge. The next 3 bolts are closely placed to protect the ledge. Work up on good holds through this section and climb into the crux of the route on the upper head wall. No particular move stands out as a stopper move. It’s more working with the smaller holds and delicate feet that make the grade. The climbing eases a little towards the anchors.

# Location
Located in the right-​​​​center on the Monument base wall.

# Protection
11 bolts, 2 fixed anchors (***The anchors still need to be extended.*** If youre TRing, extend the anchors to prevent the rope from rubbing on the rock.)
