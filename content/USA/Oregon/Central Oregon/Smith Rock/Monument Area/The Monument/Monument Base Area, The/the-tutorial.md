# Description
Delightful "monument style" huecos cruise around a chicken head as you maneuver into the crux on the face. After clipping the perma-draw move up into the stem box for secure, but slightly run-out exposure scattered with good pockets and edges. Perhaps you'll even get a chimney move in before you top out on the right side pillar.

# Location
To the right of all the moderate routes at the base of the Monument.

# Protection
10 bolts, one fixed draw, steel sport clip anchors for lowering
