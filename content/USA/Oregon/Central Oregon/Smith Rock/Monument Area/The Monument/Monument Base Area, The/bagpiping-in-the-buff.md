# Description
4 Bolts, right of Lounger; horrible shale at the top which can be easily kicked off. Challenge is at the bottom, can be avoided by stick-clipping; If not, then it might actually be a 5.7

New anchors, to make each route independant, have been set up as of 10/19/2013. This was being done after we came back from Adit Rock.
