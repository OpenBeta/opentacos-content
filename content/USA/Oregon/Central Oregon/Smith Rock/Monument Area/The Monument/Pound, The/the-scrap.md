# Description
A steeper climb that it looks. A slight overhang (relative to churning) makes decent holds engaging to climb on. Someday this route may be commonly climbed after it sees more traffic. Some crumbly rock and suspect holds may reserve most efforts.

# Location
Furthest right route on the wall. Last bit of overhang before the slab starts

# Protection
4 bolts and chains at anchors
