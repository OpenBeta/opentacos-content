# Description
On a crag known for big choss, Chosstafarian feels the biggest and chossiest.   This geologic tour takes you up a color and texture changing endless flake, through overhanging onion layers of mystery rock, to a final steep fin of tuff extruded from the upper wall of detritus.  It's well bolted and safe, but may still have you praying to the rock gods.  Are you a Chosstafarian?

Best pitches to link: 2 & 3.

P1: 5.10b***  Climb the first pitch of Jim Climbing (right-most route on the main ledge).  At the anchor, continue up and right for another 20 feet to a higher anchor and good stance at the base of a huge corner.  14 bolts.  105 ft.

P2: 5.11a**** "Bob Gnarly Flake".  Jam, face climb, bridge-the-gap, and pimp-the-flake on this signature pitch. 14 bolts. 110 ft.

P3: 5.10c***  "Dreadrocks Dihedral".  Stem, jam, and keep the barn door closed, up a steep corner to a good ledge.  6 bolts.  50 ft.

P4: 5.11c***  "No Send it, No Cry".  Follow better rock on the ridge to a rugged boulder problem straight up the fin.  Get up, stand up on the summit and yell, "Praise rock Chosstafari!!!" to the rock gods.  Then, lower back to the good ledge.  6 bolts.  60 ft.

# Location
Hike up the gully between the Monument and Anglin's Buttress for five minutes. At the end of the rock stairs look up and right for a 30 foot section of 5.4 protected by a single bolt, leading to the main ledge. Chosstafarian shares the first pitch with Jim Climbing, the farthest right route on the ledge.

# Protection
All bolted.
