P2: 5.11b**** "7/10 Split". At the first bolt left of the anchor, go straight up and crank through a couple delicate cruxes on good rock. 9 bolts. 80 ft.

P3: 5.10d** "Deception Arete".  Delicately angle up and right to gain the arete near the fifth bolt.  Continue up the exposed arete to a comfy ledge. 11 bolts. 110 feet.

P3. 5.10c****"300 Club" Continue straight up the arete to the top of Osa Thatcher's Needle. 7 bolts. 60 feet.

Descent:  Rappel the route with a single 70m rope.
