# Description
Anglin n' Danglin' is a fully bolted sport climb with sustained 5.11- climbing and mind blowing position.

Start at the bolted anchor on the left side of the main ledge. Â Linking pitches is possible but not recommended due to rope drag and large ledges.

P1. 5.11a** 30 feet of chossy 5.6 leads to a brief crux and better rock in a left facing corner. 8 bolts. 90 feet.

P2. 5.11b**** Sustained stemming in a right facing corner. Avoid the obvious descent anchor above the ninth bolt, and step left to a hidden anchor at a good stance. 9 bolts. 80 feet.

P3. 5.10c*** Straight forward face climbing leads to a comfortable ledge. 5 bolts. 40 feet.

P4. 5.11a****The money pitch! Crank on the ever steepening flake to a crux at the fourth bolt. The difficulty eases only slightly as you angle n' dangle your way across an exposed traverse to the anchors. 9 bolts. 80 feet.

P5. 5.7* A utilitarian march to the summit. Tread lightly as you follow a path of cleaning scars to the top. 70 feet.

Descent: four rappels with a single, 70 meter rope. From the anchor atop P4, rap to the descent anchor atop P2. Or, scramble off the back.

# Location
Hike up the gully between the Monument and Anglin's Buttress for five minutes. At the end of the rock stairs look up and right for a 30 foot section of 5.4 protected by a single bolt, leading to the main ledge.

# Protection
Quick draws and runners.  No pitch has more than nine bolts.
