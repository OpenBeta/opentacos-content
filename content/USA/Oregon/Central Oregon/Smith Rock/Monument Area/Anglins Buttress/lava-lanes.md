# Description
Lava Lanes clips bolts all the way to the spectacular, bowling pin shaped summit of Osa Thatcher's needle. After the first pitch, it's very exposed and sustained in the grade.  For full value, link pitches 2 and 3.

1st frame: 5.7*  "The Gutter". Start at a rappel anchor 10 feet left of the Jenga pile. Angle up and left through easy terrain on a shrinking ledge to a final 5.7 move. 6 bolts, 90 feet.

2nd frame: 5.10****  Sustained face climbing on good holds. 10 bolts, 90 feet.

3rd frame: 5.10***  A couple cruxes in the first 40 feet, then easier terrain on spaced out bolts lead to a comfortable ledge. 7 bolts, 90 feet.

4th frame: 5.10c**** "300 Club". Engaging arete action leads to a crux overhang, and the coffee table sized summit. 7 bolts, 60ft.

# Location
Lava Lanes starts on the main ledge of Anglin's Buttress, accessed by the bolted 5.4 approach.

# Protection
Fully bolted with steel 'biners on the anchors.

For the least rock fall, rappel 7/10 Split

to the main ledge with a single 70m rope.  A single 60m rope will work for rappelling Lava Lanes.
