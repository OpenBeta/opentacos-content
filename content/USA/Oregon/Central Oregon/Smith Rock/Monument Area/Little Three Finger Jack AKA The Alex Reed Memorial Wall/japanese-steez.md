# Description
This route features overhanging climbing, hard face climbing, and 3 distinct roofs too clear. It has good rest here and there but the difficulty is persistent until it gets even harder at the last 3 bolts. While the roofs seem to be the where the hardest climbing would be, the technical headwall at the top will leave many strong climbers perplexed by the lack of holds.

# Location
3rd most left route. Branches off Asian Persuasion after the 2nd bolt.

# Protection
Bolted. A couple extended draws at the start will help with rope drag.
