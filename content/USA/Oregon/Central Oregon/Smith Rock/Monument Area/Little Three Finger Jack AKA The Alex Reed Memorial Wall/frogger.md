# Description
One of smith's steeper hard routes that also features good holds. A hard crux pulling a bulge (maybe v7)Â on slopers leads to a 5.12- finish that stays steep till the anchors. Start off a giant jug sticking out from the wall and continue straight up. Where Rot-Punkt Funk traverses left, Frogger Goes out right. Seems a little sketchy above the ledge off the last bolt the two routes share, but the fall has been crash dummied and proven safe.

# Location
Start off a giant jug sticking out of the wall at arms reach. Continue straight up to the upper overhang.

# Protection
over 10 bolts
