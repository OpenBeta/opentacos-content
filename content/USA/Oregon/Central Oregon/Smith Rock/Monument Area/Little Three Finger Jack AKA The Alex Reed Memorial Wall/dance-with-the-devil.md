# Description
The route begins on protruding knobs and moderate climbing. At the 6th bolt, the crux starts on slopers, dances across devious little crimps, and culminates with powerful moves into, and out of, a large sidepull. After a no-hands rest on the slab, the upper wall still packs a punch with burly underclings, moving right to an arete at the finish.

Save this one for a cold day in hell.

# Location
Middle of the wall, starts on two lemon-size knobs.

# Protection
11 bolts. Fixed steel anchors.Â Nice to have an extended draw on the last bolt.
