# Description
Country Rhoads starts out on the far right side of The Little Three Finger Jack formation. Start out by mantling up on a small formation set below a roof. Work through the roof sequence and climb through the next 3 bolts on good holds. From a good rest, work into the first crux of the route slapping your way up around a slopey bulge with the sequence ending with a crossing throw to a jug; true hero climbing! (A new sequence has been worked out foregoing the big cross.) Climb past the bulge through a cruxy face section and link into the huge flake/crack system above. The third and final crux is pulling the roof crack before the anchors.

(There is a huge block chocked under the massive flake above covered with “X’s”. Do not climb on this block! It’s easily avoidable and does not affect the route.)
