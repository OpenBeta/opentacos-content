# Description
Start out climbing on big jugs and slopers up to the 3rd bolt. Make a move to clip the 4th bolt and establish onto the ledge above. The next 2 bolts are spaced closer together to protect from hitting the ledge. (The first of the two bolts is placed on a bulge sticking out farther than the rest of the wall. This further out plain makes for a clean fall going to the second bolt. Iâ€™ve taken the fall a couple times and your feet barely touch the wall.) Traverse left through the overhanging bulge and establish onto the slab. The traverse and making the clip are the crux. Establish onto the slab and move up and left. Committing technical slab climbing on good holds leads to an overhanging arete corner overhead. Climb over the corner, make some easier moves on good holds up to the last clip. Climb the last bouldery section on ok holds to the anchors.

# Location
Rot-Punkt Funk starts on the left side of the wall under the huge slab above. It is currently the furthest most left established route on the wall. This route branches off to the left and also has a variation that goes right and up to separate independent anchors (Frogger, 5.13).

# Protection
14 bolts, Fixed steel anchors
