# Description
The crux comes right off the ground with some big, powerful moves on sidepulls (think Energy Crisis but more fun). Pass a difficult roof at the 4th bolt, then the rest of the route features 5.11- climbing on steep and interesting rock, moving left on a nice exposed slab at the finish.

# Location
Starts on left-facing sidepull flake and heads for a patch of gold rock midway up.

# Protection
13 bolts, stick clip
