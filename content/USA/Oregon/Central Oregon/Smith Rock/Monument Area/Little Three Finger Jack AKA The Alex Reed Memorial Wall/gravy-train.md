# Description
A great route on good rock with a heartbreaking crux at the top and varied climbing.

Start off on some 5.10+ climbing on some crumbly stone before you get to the good rock 3 bolts up. Work through multiple roofs and crux's separated by some decent rest. Good technique is just as necessary as overall strength, being that the climb has so many different styles of difficult climbing throughout the route. The actual crux comes up top passing the 2nd to last bolt on the near vertical slab. There is also a notable crux passing the 6th bolt.

# Location
3rd most left route on the right side of the Little Three Finger Jack.

# Protection
Bolted
