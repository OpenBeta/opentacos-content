# Description
Start climbing up the seam on good holds. Climb through the 1st roof sequence pulling the lip on jugs. The next 3 roofs are where the business is. You're met with a hard move clearing or pulling over each roof section on the route. The crux is past the 3rd roof on the face and the redpoint crux (for me) was clearing the 4th roof.

MAKE SURE TO FEED OUT A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF SLACK CLIMBING THROUGH THE CRUX PAST THE 3rd ROOF! Falling through the crux and getting short roped causes the climber to fall into the roof at knee height. Drop the climber well below the roof for a clean fall!

# Location
Asian Persuasion is located between Gravy Train and Country Rhoads on the far right side of the Little Three Finger Jack formation.

# Protection
14 bolts, fixed anchors.
