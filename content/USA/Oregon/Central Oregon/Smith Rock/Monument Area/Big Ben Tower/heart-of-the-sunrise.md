# Description
P1: 5.12b Start out climbing in the obvious crack system. Clip the first 2 bolts from the crack and work right onto the face. Climb through the boulderly 5.11 sections working up and left. After a good rest at bolt 5, work back into the crack system climbing on good holds up to another great rest just below the mini roof. Once into the roof sequence the route stays on you until you pull the lip 15’ above the roof. Do a couple more slab moves until you clip the chains. (Using the large hand crack to the left of the crux sequence knocks the grade down significantly.)

P2: 5.13a? The second pitch is a red-tagged route! Please do not climb!!

P3: 5.10 From the second pitch anchors of Heart of the Sunrise, clip 1 bolt above the anchors and pull a bulge move linking you into the last fully bolted pitch of Alpen Symphony to the summit.

# Location
