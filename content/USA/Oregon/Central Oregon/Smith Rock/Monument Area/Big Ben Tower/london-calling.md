# Description
London Calling follows a crack to the left of the 5.12 sport climb, Heart of Sunrise.  It stays independent for the initial 30 feet, then as the natural protection runs out, it joins HOS for three bolts before cutting left toward a steep and splitter fist crack for the final 40 feet.

Props to Chris Hatzai for installing this route's anchor and cleaning Heart of Sunrise.  London Calling piggybacks off his initial efforts.

# Location
London Calling is on the left (South West) side of Big Ben.  It's a fairly obvious crack five feet to the left of a sport climb (Heart of Sunrise).

# Protection
Double set of cams from fingers to fists.  Save two #3 and two #4 Camalots for the upper fist/wide hand crack.
