# Description
Just right of Good Dobby. Ascend juggy, low angle, albeit loose terrain at roughly 10- to a midway anchor. From here, the rock changes texture for the better and becomes vertical and challenging. Tackle an obvious roof featuring strenuous reaches & trickery. The final bolts protect loose terrain; caveat emptor.
