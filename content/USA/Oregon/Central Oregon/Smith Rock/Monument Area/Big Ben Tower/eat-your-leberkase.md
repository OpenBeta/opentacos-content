# Description
Extension rising above Good Dobby. Leave the anchors and stem up to a jug. The crux is mostly straightforward pulling on flat holds through the bulge. Should be a quick tick for those up for the grade.

*Leberkase consists of corned beef, pork and bacon, ground up and baked into a loaf.

# Location
Above Good Dobby, the juggy slab on the right side of Big Ben

# Protection
Once runout, there are now 4 bolts on the extension. 70m rope to lower off, otherwise lower to the Good Dobby anchor first.
