# Description
Time Moves Slow starts out to the left side of a small gully on the Big Ben Tower. Start out climbing on easy terrain up through bolt 2. Make an easy traverse over the gully on well cleaned holds to establish onto the main feature of the Big Ben Tower. Ride the easy slab up on big holds up to the meat of the climb. From here the wall turns dead vertical and starts to get a bit harder. Climb straight up and make the traverse left, being met with the crux of the route. Climb through the crux on good holds and keep climbing left and upÂ on sustained terrain to the anchors.

# Location
