# Description
Crux is getting off the ground to the first bolt.  The rest of the route is sustained.

When the climber approaches the top and starts to traverse left, there is some loose rock.    Belayer should stay as close to the wall as possible and wear a helmet.

Would give this two stars after more traffic and most of the loose rock is cleared out.

# Location
Route is in the middle of the Big Ben Tower, on a rounded arete immediately right of a 5.12 bolted water groove.

# Protection
8 bolts + anchors
