# Description
The obvious groove directly left of

You Break It, You Buy It

hosts a high quality, technical route. Climb the slab below the first bolt and get ready to rock yourself right into the business. From this point on, you resist succumbing to the barn door until the chains. Make your way up tiny crimps and smeary feet for a few bolts, then balance your way into the right facing side pull. Take a breather, grab the good edges above, and slowly make your way up to a scoop. You get a really good rest here before you pull the final bulge and clip the chains.

Stick clipping the first bolt is recommended. Not runout like it says in the Watt's guide.
