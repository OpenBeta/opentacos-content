# Description
Climb pockets on low angle rock until it steepens to balancy sidepulls and edges. It feels runout at points but the falls are clean. the crux comes at a small crimpy sidepull and moves delicately up to a posotive edge. the anchors are wierd to clip and feels somewhat spicy.

# Location
midway along the base of big ben sits a slab with many pockets. look for the only face climb that is complely bolted in the middle of this wall.

# Protection
7 bolts. Rap anchors.
