# Description
A good sustained climb at the 5.8/5.9 level that makes for an enjoyable few hours.

Start by climbing Adventurous 9904 which is on a large pillar. From near Asterisk pass the pillar looks partially detached. Shade in the morning, 5th pitch gives you sun past the first bolt; a well-deserved warm up in the cold months. 2nd-3rd, 4th-5th pitches can be linked using a 70m rope.

Pitch 1: 5.8

Romp up on knobs past several bolts to the top of the Pillar and belay.

Pitch 2: 5.9

Start by leaning over the chimney that separates the main wall and the pillar to clip a bolt then step across. Crux is right below the second bolt. Climb up and left to a belay anchor.

Pitch 3: 5.9

Move up and left to a small ledge just above the belay and make an airy move onto the face. Climb up and left on knobs and pockets, airy and exciting! There is another bolted line that goes straight up a few bolts after stepping across, do not follow it. Belay at the base of an arete after about 60 feet.

Pitch 4: 5.9

Make a few exciting moves up the arete before veering right and following an edge dropping away below your feet. The climbing eases a bit before reaching a belay on a low angled slab.

Pitch 5: 5.8

Race up the slab and then finish on jugs on one final steep section of the headwall and belay.
