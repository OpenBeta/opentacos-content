# Description
Pony Up sports fun movement on rock that's still questionable in spots.  The crux upper face is steep  and high quality, but the lower traverse over a roof can create some awkward fall potential for both leader and follower.

# Location
Climb My Little Pony to the 4th bolt, then go up and right over a roof (.10-).  Continue up 20 ft of mediocre slab to a steep face.

# Protection
13 bolts to chain anchors
