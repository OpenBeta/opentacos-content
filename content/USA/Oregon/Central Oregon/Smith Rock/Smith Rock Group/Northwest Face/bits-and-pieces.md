# Description
With the addition of more bolts the first pitch makes an excellent first sport lead.  The vast majority only do the first pitch as the second pitch is dirty and is essentially unprotectable.

# Location
An easily found water groove about fifty feet left of the start to Wherever I May Roam.

# Protection
Quickdraws. Two bolt anchor.
