# Description
The crux is an off width chimney up high on the first pitch. It matters which way you face in the off width. The second pitch is a fourth class scramble up the scree to the base of a wall. Third pitch follow the path of least resistance up and right to the top. The only rout that goes to the summit of the Northwest Face Center. Adventure climbers enjoy the alpine setting-everyone else stays away.
