# Description
Start out the route with easy jugs and a crack to clip the first bolt. Continue up the slab with jug holds/pockets and good feet. The crux is at the middle of the route. Although it's been cleaned to some degree, the route is still new and be aware of lichen and choss.

# Location
Right of Chalk Wave and left of Chalk Therapy, in between the two routes.

# Protection
8 Glue-ins, plus anchor with chains.
