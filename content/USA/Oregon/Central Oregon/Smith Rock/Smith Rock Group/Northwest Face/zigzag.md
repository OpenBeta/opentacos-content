# Description
Sketchy start on loose, oftentimes crumbling rock. Off-width almost the entire way with enough solid face holds to make it almost enjoyable. Watch out for weak and loose rock! Plenty of cam and nut placements, but expect to push 1"-3" pieces unless you bring multiples. 1st pitch ends at slung horn; possible 2nd pitch for the more adventurous looks a bit harder but on better rock.

# Location
Around the far corner south of Asterisk Pass, Â look for the obvious tall lightning bolt crack right of vertical sport routes but left of Chalk Wave.

# Protection
Cams to 4", large nuts, possible new sling for rappel
