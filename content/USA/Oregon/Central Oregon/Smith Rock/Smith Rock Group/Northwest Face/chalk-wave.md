# Description
This wonderful slab has good rock and fun moves all the way up. Though it is rated 5.8, the only 5.8 climbing is maybe a move or two shortly after leaving the ground. After that, the climbing just gets easier but stays fun the whole way. Expect big pockets and side pulls.

# Location
Go uphill until you hit a wall with many pockets covering it's face. just to the right is a gully continuing a ways to the top. Chalk Wave is the left most bolt line on the slab face.

# Protection
9 bolts. anchors.
