# Description
This mixed route starts by surmounting a detached rock to reach the first bolt. Cruxy vertical face climbing on solid rock leads you up to and around a blunt arete. Run out an easy slab to another bolt and the beginning of the hand crack. The crack can be painful(consider taping) but is very secure with plenty of footholds, like an easier version of Karate Crack. The crack turns low angle and wide, then a final bolt appears. Belay from the rap anchor up and right, hidden under a sage bush on a small ledge.

Rappel with 2 ropes, or make 2 raps with a single 60m using the Westside Solitude anchor.

# Location
About 100 feet right of Wherever I May Roam, look for the jagged hand crack starting 60 feet up.

# Protection
8 bolts plus a single set of cams from #1 to #4, optional extra #3
