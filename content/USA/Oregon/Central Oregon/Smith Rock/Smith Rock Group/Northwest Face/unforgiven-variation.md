# Description
Climb a fun lieback crack on a slightly overhangging wall above the 2nd pitch of Wherever I May Roam. Once you pull over the lip, the steepness eases but the fun continues. Follow the bolts up to the base of a very overhanging wall on good face holds. Watch out of loose rocks at the anchor. This is a variation just before the traverse 3rd pitch of Wherever I May Roam, if you continue up No Pain No Gain (5.11 overhanging tips crack) you will merge back to the 4th pitch anchor.

# Location
Climb the first 2 pitches of Wherever I May Roam, the bolted line on a slightly overhanging crack should be visible from the belay anchor. It should be directly above the first bolt on the 3rd pitch of Wherever I May Roam. You can rap back to the second belay of WIMR with a 60m - knot the ends because it's pretty close to 30m

# Protection
10 bolts with bolted anchor and rap rings, good idea to extend the last draw.
