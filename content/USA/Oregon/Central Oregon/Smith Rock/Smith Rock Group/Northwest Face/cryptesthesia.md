# Description
Start up the face on suspect nubbins to the first bolt then the rock improves and the edgy climbing begins. the crux could be around the fifth bolt or just shy of the fourth. depends on style. The route returns to suspect nubbins at the last bolt to anchors. the hard climbing all comes when the rock is good.

# Location
This route can be found on the far right side of the northwest face. Go around the corner of the main routes until the trail starts to cut sharply upward and it'll be on your left beside a big zig zag crack.

# Protection
6 bolts, anchors w/ chains.
