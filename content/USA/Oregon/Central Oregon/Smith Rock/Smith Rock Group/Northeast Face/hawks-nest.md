# Description
Hawks Nest can be climbed as a single pitch 5.9, or continue up Risky Pass (5.10c)  and Skydive (5.10c), to make a spectacular three pitch bolted climb.

P1 (5.9) Step across a mini-chimney to reach the first bolt. Fun nubbins and good position.  The crux pinches past nubbins near the third bolt.  Lower from anchors below the top of the tower (60 ft) or, to climb the second pitch (Risky Pass 5.10c), continue to the top of the tower, step across a chimney and up to an anchor at a comfortable ledge.

This route is named after the section of the Seattle Seahawks' stadium behind the goal post.  It has a birds' eye view of the entire arena.  The first ascent happened just after the Seahawks won the Superbowl in 2014.

The second pitch, Risky Pass (5.10c, FA 2/15), commemorates the questionable play call that cost the Seahawks the Superbowl in 2015.
