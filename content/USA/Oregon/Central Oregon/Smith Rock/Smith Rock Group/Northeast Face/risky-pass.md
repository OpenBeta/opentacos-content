# Description
Risky Pass is a 110 foot, second pitch, sustained 5.10 with breath-taking position and still evolving rock quality.  When accessed via Orion (5.10a), and finished off with Skydive (5.10c), it's a spectacular three pitch bolted route.

It's named after the questionable play call that cost the Seahawks the Superbowl in 2015, and was originally ascended as a second pitch to Hawks Nest, a route named in honor of the Seahawks' winning Superbowl effort in 2014.

# Location
Risky Pass is located on the same feature as Sky Ridge, but on the East (main area) facing aspect.  It can be accessed any of three ways: via Asterisk Pass and  the first pitch of Sky Ridge , as a second pitch to Hawks Nest (better), or as a second pitch/extension to Orion (best!).  When linked in a single pitch with Orion, it's a 190 ft, sustained 5.10 with 20 bolts.

# Protection
11 bolts to chain anchors on a comfortable ledge.  Belay at the top. Descent: two rappels down the East face with a single 60 meter rope.
