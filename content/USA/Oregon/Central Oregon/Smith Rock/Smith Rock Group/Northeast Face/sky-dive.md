# Description
Quoted from Smith Rock State Park falcon guide:

"The original 1968 finish aided a bolt line on the overhanging summit block. Climb an easy bolted slab above the first-pitch anchor and free a short, knobby bulge with great protection and dizzying exposure."

# Location
Starts at the 3rd pitch anchor of Sky Ridge. Sky Dive is a variation to Sky Ridge which goes directly up the overhanging roof section rather than traversing out left to the handcrack 4th pitch of Sky Ridge.

Finishes as for Sky Ridge. 2 60m raps off the west face reach the ground.

# Protection
6 bolts
