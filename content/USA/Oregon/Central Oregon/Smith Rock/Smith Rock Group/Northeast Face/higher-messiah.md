# Description
Higher Messiah is an extension or second pitch to the 5.10 base route, Leper Messiah.  It links into a single pitch from the ground, creating a 20 bolt, 165 ft. mega-pitch with the 5.11 crux near the top.

Caution:

At mid-height it crosses a nearly unavoidable and mysteriously attached large block.  A two hour cleaning session with a crowbar produced the current, seemingly solid configuration (Oct. 2018).  Tread lightly. Geologic time includes now.

# Location
Start on Leper Messiah and continue straight up the second pitch.

# Protection
9 bolts as a second pitch, or 20 clips for the full link-up.
