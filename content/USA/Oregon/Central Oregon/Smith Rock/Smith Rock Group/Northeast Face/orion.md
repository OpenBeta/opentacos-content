# Description
Sustained .10- nubbins with a crux passing the second bolt. Starts up a 12 ft flake of so-so rock to get to the high quality upper wall.

Clip the anchor at 85 feet and lower, or continue up and right to Risky Pass (5.10c). This can be broken up into a second pitch, or for full-value, go for the Orion Pass mega-pitch, 20 bolts and 165 feet! Belay at the top and make two rappels with a 60 meter rope.

# Location
Second bolted route left of Asterisk Pass.  30 ft. left of Hawks Nest.

# Protection
9 bolts to chain anchors with steel 'biners.
