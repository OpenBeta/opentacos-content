# Description
Kevin’s Arete is the striking line between the upper pitches of White Satin and Lost in Space.  Climb the first pitch if Lost in Space to a two bolt anchor below a steep and leaning bolted crack.

The second pitch is the money pitch.  After starting up the crack, compose yourself on a hanging slab before embarking on a beautifully varied journey up the more challenging terrain above.

It’s best to rappel down from the top of pitch two and either continue up a different route from the big ledge or to confine rapping to the ground. (barely doable with a 70 and some tricky shenanigans)

It’s also possible to top the route out via Lost in Space from the top of pitch two, but the terrain between the two anchors is 5.6 r/x dirty choss and not recommended.

# Location
Starts via Lost in Space.

# Protection
Bolts.
