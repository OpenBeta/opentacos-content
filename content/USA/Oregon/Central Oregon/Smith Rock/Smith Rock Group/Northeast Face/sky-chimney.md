# Description
Get high above the Crooked River with this fun three pitch route. The original first pitch (5.6) is a low quality grunt but pitch two (5.7) to the small belay cove and the last pitch (5.7) make this climb worth doing.

# Location
The start is at the base of the heart shaped rock that sits to the left of Asterisk Pass.  Either rap off the west side on hard to find rap anchors or 'walk' off by scrambling down a west side gully.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches.  Be sure to know how to build anchors as the belay cove requires some skill to create a safe anchor.
