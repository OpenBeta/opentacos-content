# Description
A true Smith classic, really solid old school 5.9, a bit of rotten rock, small runouts and a little bit of aid. There are two different options for pitch 1.

P1 5.6 30' - This is the original party's line but not the best option. Climb up a left leaning ramp/gully to an old bolt belay.

P1 Alt. 5.9 90' - Climb a sport pitch starting in the same location as the original line. 7 or 8 clips get you to a two bolt belay.

P2 5.7R 70' - From either the original or alternative pitch 1 anchors, head up and right and enter the chimney/groove. Trash up this rotten delight plugging cams up to 8" wide where possible. Exit up a ramp trending right before it gets too steep and end at a large belay ledge with two new bolts.

P3 5.8 C1 60' - From the belay traverse the bolt ladder to the left on new bolts to and awkward exit move (nuts helpful) into some chossy stone. Head up left to a belay ledge with two bolts. 2nd should follow by aiding which would be easier than jugging.

P4 5.7 120' - Power over the bulge and follow the mostly solid left trending ramp to a 2 bolt anchor beneath the P5 roof.

P5 5.10a 140' - Move up the block and follow the crack thru the roof. Step around the corner and voila here is the 80' of corner crack. Starting as a slab corner it progressively gets steeper as one goes. The crack varies from hands to fists to tips and finishes with an awkward wide exit on to a ledge. Follow the easy way up for 30' to a 2 bolt belay.

P6 5.9 110' - Continue up a slab to a steep well protected step and corner. A short rising traverse to the right leads one into easier ground and to the summit where there are three bolted anchors.
