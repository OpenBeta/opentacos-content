# Description
A proud line up the impressive NE Ridge of the Smith Rock Group, Skyridge takes a bold line on nubbins for almost 1/2 a pitch before the first bolt. Confidence and commitment is needed to get onto this climb, but the rest of the bolted first and second pitches are beautiful climbing, with a final pitch of hand traversing (gear to 3") to finish near the top of the Smith Rock group.

# Location
From the Asterisk Pass trail (don't go completely over the Pass), head left (south) along the western side of the ridge until you find a spot for a shakey cam placement for the belayer. Climb begins on the west side, and moves to the east side of the ridge after a couple bolts, then directly up the ridge with stunning exposure. Final pitch hand traverse can be avoided by taking the "sky dive" variation, a few moves of bolted airy 5.10 to the top.

# Protection
A FEW Bolts on the first pitch, but super runout at the start, with lots of exposure on either side of Asterisk Pass. Second pitch bolted, third pitch small nuts / cams (be sure to protect for second).

A single rack from fingers to fists with nuts is suggested. Hexes would work well in many spots. Bring several alpine draws to reduce rope drag on pitch three.

The third pitch also requires gear for the belay, located at the end of the traverse.
