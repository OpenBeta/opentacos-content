# Description
Use the corner crack to get to the first bolt. After clipping the second bolt, it's sustained action on nubbins and pockets all the way to the anchors at 105 ft. Crux hits around the 10th bolt.

"End of passion play, crumbling away

Veins that pump with fear

Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me you will see

More is all you need

Obey your Master"

-Metallica, Master of Puppets
