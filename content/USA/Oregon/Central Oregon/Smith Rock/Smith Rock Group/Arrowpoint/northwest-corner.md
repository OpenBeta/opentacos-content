# Description
A fun route to a fine summit with a superb view.

Scramble approach to the south side of Arrowpoint. Â Contour around the base of the formation to the west.

Climb up nifty and reasonably secure crack system on the Northwest Corner.

Plan on a downclimb of the route due to lack of robust summit anchors.

# Location
Located on the Northwest side of the formation.

# Protection
A couple cams in the medium to 3" size range.  No secure top anchors (plan on down climbing).
