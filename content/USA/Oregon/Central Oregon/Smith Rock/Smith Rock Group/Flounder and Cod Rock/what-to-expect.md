# Description
Quite fun for the grade and location.  I would recommend climbing up the chopped bolt line after setting up a top rope on the flounder block.  If you find yourself there for a period of time, it is the better of the two routes.

# Location
Left of the bolt line on Flounder Block.  Look for chopped bolts

# Protection
Top Rope after leading When Expecting
