# Description
Start directly below the roof and trend right up poor quality rock. Once in line with the left traversing hand crack cut back left, passing a bolt (might want to skip this since it adds rope drag and doesn't do a whole lot of good). Get into the crack follow it along to its finish with some fun moves to get out on crumbly rock (nothing too sketchy for the moves needed, but be aware).

# Location
From Flounder Block look up and left up the hill and you will see a striking hand crack under a roof

# Protection
Gear, mostly in the 0.5 - 2 in range
