# Description
Fun slab route with pockets and knobs. Start the route by climbing the small block then onto the slab face. After clipping the 5th bolt (a long quickdraw useful) mantle onto the small ledge. You can clip the 6th bolt from the small ledge that would protect the crux move. There are varieties of nubbins and pockets and jugs to create your own way to the top. The last steep section before the anchor can be climbed through straight up (funner) or go around to the left opening and back (easier but chossy). Although the crucial holds are substantially cleaned beautiful lichens co-exist.

# Location
This route is located just left of Sunset Boulevard, on the left slab face of Cod Rock formation.

# Protection
11 glue-in bolts, plus anchor with chains.
