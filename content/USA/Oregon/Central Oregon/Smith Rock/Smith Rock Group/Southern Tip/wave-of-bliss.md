# Description
An exciting route on mostly good rock with tricky route finding and some serious runouts on solid 5.10 terrain.

Starting right of the arete, climb past two bolts (crux) and work up a ramp (pin) to a welcome stance.  Place the #2 and/or #3 camalot in a pocket on the face left of the arete and climb up to bolt.  Continue up to the next bolt 35 feet above.  Work up the face protected by a critical wire placement and another bolt, eventually reaching easier ground.  From here, the rock quality deteriorates somewhat.  Traverse right to the South Park anchor or continue to the top passing one more bolt.

# Location
The arete and face left of Kunza Korner.

# Protection
6 bolts, 1 pin, small wires/RPs, #2 and #3 camalots

All bolts appear to be original (3/8" with smc hangers).

A cam in the 1"-1.75" range could be useful as well.
