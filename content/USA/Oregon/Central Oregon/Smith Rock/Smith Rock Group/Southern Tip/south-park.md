# Description
Great arete climb away from the hordes. Shares the same start as Wave of Bliss but stays on the arete.

The first bolt is about 15' up the arete followed by another bolt, then a piton. Once past the piton the climbing becomes much more difficult but well protected.

Technical arete climbing on crimps and smears lead to slightly easier ground just below the anchor.

# Location
The stunning arete to the left of Kunza Korner

# Protection
