# Description
Similar in the feel of the rock and the movement to Amelia Dearheart, Taylor Brook is a decent 5.7.  This one holds a bit more lichen and moss, though.

After leading the two routes to its right, TR this one off of the anchors for Amelia Dearheart.

It's too bad that it lost its bolts.  It's better than other routes at Smith, and the more easy routes, the better.  It spreads out the packs, and allows the area to continue evolving.  Maybe there was a good reason(?).

# Location
Left of Amelia Dearheart, on the Waterfall Slab at the Southern Tip of the Smith Rock Group.
