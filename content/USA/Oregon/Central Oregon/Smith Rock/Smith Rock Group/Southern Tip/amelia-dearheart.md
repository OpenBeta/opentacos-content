# Description
A decent 5.7, but not as cool as 9999.  You might as well do it if you are there.  The opening moves provide the grade; finish on a long, easy featured slab.

# Location
Next to 9999 on the Waterfall Slab at the Southern Tip of the Smith Rock Group.

# Protection
5 or 6 bolts and chains for anchors.
