# Description
This route is a bit creaky and delicate at the bottom, then pulls through a small bulge before the finish. The anchors on this route are missing, so you're better off veering right after the fourth bolt and finishing on 'I'm Your Hate'. This variation is listed in the guide book as 'St√∂gerific'.

# Location
The first route to the left of 'I'm Your Hate'.

# Protection
6 bolts. This route lacks anchors.
