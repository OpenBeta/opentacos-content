# Description
I would have to konsider Kunza Korner one of the best klimbs in the park! Worth the hike for sure.

Start just left of the cave and follow the corner to an anchor just below the roof.

Things start out pretty easy and build slowly as you ascend. The crux is thin and involves some face holds. You can sew the crux up with small stoppers but they are small so place a few.

# Location
just right of the arete Wave of Bliss, just left of the cave.

# Protection
Stoppers,TCU's and Cams to .75. Bring extra small sized stoppers to sew up the crux.
