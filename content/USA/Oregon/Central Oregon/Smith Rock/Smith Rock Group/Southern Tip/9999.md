# Description
Not bad for a 5.6.  The rock feels like the best parts of Red Wall, and the climbing is actually fun.  It starts on a heavily textured slab, and moves into a cool layback.

We took some kids out here.  They couldn't do the lay-backing at the top, but had a great time.  And it wasn't too bad for the adults: relatively secluded, decent climbing.

# Location
Reach the Southern tip by hiking between 25 to 40 minutes, depending on speed, across the bridge, to the left, and past the main area and Phoenix Buttress.  When you see an awesome looking dihedral (Kunza Korner), and a few boulders, you are close.

Just around the corner is the Waterfall Slab, which holds this route and two 5.7s (one bolted, another chopped).  This is the right-most route on the red rock.

# Protection
5 bolts, 2 bolt anchor. A bit run-out for the first time leader, I bet.
