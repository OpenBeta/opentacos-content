# Description
Worth climbing if you are in the area...

Start in a bolted dihedral and stem up to a weird crux moving onto the face. Head up and right to an anchor.

About 15 feet left of the anchor is a huge partialy detached flake with an owl's nest behind it. Be respectful not to disturb.

# Location
First route left of Wave Of Bliss

# Protection
bolts
