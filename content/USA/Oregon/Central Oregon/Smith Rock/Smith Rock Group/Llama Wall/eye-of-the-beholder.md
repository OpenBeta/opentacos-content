# Description
Great route and great rock.  Intricate climbing down low leads to a challenging, lieback bulge at midheight.  The feet are wicked through the crux! More great climbing leads to a fun finish.

# Location
Left side of Llama wall. Fairly obvious finish stepping hard right around an overhang.

# Protection
Bolts. Well protected, though there are a few tricky clips.
