# Description
This is a somewhat popular single pitch, but is only the start of the four pitch route

The Struggle Within

.

A mix of 5.9 to 5.10 stemming, laybacking, edging, etc. leads to a crux traverse to the left. Sequential enough that I had to downclimb out of my dead-end and go back up to do it right. Don't tire yourself out, you have a long way to go. Make sure to traverse to the left two bolts before the anchor that sits straight up. The climbing is easy by the time you can clip the last bolt.

# Location
The bolt line just left of

Harvester of Sorrow

.

# Protection
Bolts + chain anchor
