# Description
If you stay to the right of Blackened, then you're climbing "Lightly Toasted," a 5.11b. If you stay to the left on the face, then you're on Blackened, the 5.11d... hence the contrivance, since the same boltline is used to protect both routes.

Nervous climbers often refuse to leave the security of the crack, clipping bolts to the left on Blackened while bypassing the hardest moves.

# Location
Right of Blackened, at Llama Wall

# Protection
9 bolts
