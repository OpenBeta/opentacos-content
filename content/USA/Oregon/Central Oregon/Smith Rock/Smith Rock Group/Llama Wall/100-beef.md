Another bouldery line complements Living Large just to the left. This route consist of more power and compression style crux's as to where Living Large works power and opposition.

Although this route has great quality rock, the moves are hard enough to keep most away. Even the locals shy away from this lines as well as Living Large.

# Location
Left of Living Large 5.13b and right of Eye of the Beholder 5.11c/5.12a ;)

# Protection
5 bolts
