# Description
The route has three distinct sections:

Like the other routes on this wall, start by scrambling 15 feet to the top of the choss ledge.

From here the rock and climbing improve significantly. The crux involves pulling sometimes-small pockets through a gentle prow.

After finishing the crux transition into the upper headwall/dihedral for good old fashioned fun on steeper rock and big holds.
