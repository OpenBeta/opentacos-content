# Description
This short route packs a punch with short bouldery cruxes that vary in style on excellent quality rock. Start up the slab to the 2nd bolt (5.9) and work into the first crux. Find out whether you want to dyno or look for a static sequence to get to a giant jug. Traverse out off the jug into the overhanging into a stemming crux and continue to work out left past the roof. Once established above the roof, the climbing eases off, but there is still one last move to establish yourself above all the hard climbing, I fell here 5 times on point. I also watched professional climbers fall all over this climb and go onsight Rude Boys (5.13b R).

...So expect a hard route for the grade!! Damn old school sandbaggers!
