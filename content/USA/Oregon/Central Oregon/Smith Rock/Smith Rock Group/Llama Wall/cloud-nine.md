# Description
Start by soloing up a broken ledge system, clipping a bolt just as things start to get steep again. Fun climbing with some rests leads to the second to last bolt where funky crux guards the chains. During the lower section this route seems to share some terrain with American Nirvana but the crux is completely independent.

# Location
Bolted line (tan hangers) between American Nirvana and Blackened

# Protection
Bolts (tan Metolius hangers). Long slings recommended for first and penultimate bolts
