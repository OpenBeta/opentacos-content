# Description
Varying sized pockets dot a red streak up the face to a particularly grim blank section coming out of a concave feature.  The key crimp came tumbling down, along with a dinner plate sized chunk of rock, rendering the already stout crux even harder.  Belayer may wish to wear a helmet for this one, and or belay from further down the hill.

# Location
The rightmost route at Llama Wall.  Up a little hill from the flat belay area of Junkshow, Llama Enlightment, etc.

# Protection
fatty bolt anchor, rap
