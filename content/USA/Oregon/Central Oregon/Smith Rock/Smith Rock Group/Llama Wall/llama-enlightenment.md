# Description
This route is worth doing and is well protected.

Start up overhanging jugs to vertical ground with some perplexing bulges. Closely spaced bolts. Eventually reach the base of a corner system and move right following the bolts (crux) and belay at a bolt anchor.

A second pitch continues up the lower angled slab above, going at 5.5.

# Location
About 150 yards north of Blackened, just left of Wannabe Llamas (a short bolted stemming route) and to the right of Junkshow.

# Protection
bolts
