# Description
A little climbed route considering how busy Phoenix Buttress can be.  Frustrating climbing figuring out what is the intended line versus whats there decreases enjoyment for many.  Choose your own line in about a 4 foot swath on either side of the bolt line for part of the route.  You can avoid the apparent intended crux by staying left at the 2nd bolt.

# Location
Just right of

Phoenix

, on the right side of the formation.

# Protection
Bolts. Optional Cam  before the first bolt.
