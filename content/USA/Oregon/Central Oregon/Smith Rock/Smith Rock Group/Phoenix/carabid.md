# Description
If not for difficult to place protection and runout sections Carabid would make an excellent first gear lead. From the standard start climb a crack system up about 100 feet and then use a hand traverse right to reconnect to the crack system.  Continue up a few feet and then traverse left about 20 feet to a set of bolt anchors. A 50-meter rope will reach the anchors for Drill 'em and Fill 'em or Phoenix.  A second rap reaches the ground.  A 60-meter rope will reach the standard start then down climb to gully to the ground.

# Location
Start 20 feet right and 20 feet above the base of Drill 'em and Fill 'em by scrambling up the obvious gully to the standard start - a level spot below a discontinuous crack system.  An optional start begins 20 feet to the right of Drill 'em and Fill 'em and below the standard start at a obvious crack system.  The optional start adds about 20 feet to this already fairly long one-pitch route.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5 inches but mostly small to medium nuts and cams plus standard-length runners.
