# Description
This climb starts as per When Llamas Bolt, but rides the slab up the right side of the arete, with the leader clipping somewhat awkwardly around the left corner. Clip three of these arete bolts this way, moving up until all holds are gone, then carefully move right to join the crux of Hissing Llamas. A touch of caution is prudent here, as a fall would whip you around the corner.

# Location
Starts as per When Llamas Bolt, finishes on Hissing Llamas.

# Protection
bolts.
