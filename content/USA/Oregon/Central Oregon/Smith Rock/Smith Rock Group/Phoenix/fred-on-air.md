# Description
A tricky crux past a bulge down low can be bypassed by cheating left to the arete.  The best part of the route is above this in the steep, beautiful finishing slab, finessing moves between small pockets.

# Location
Just left of

License To Bolt

(which has ring bolts) and right of the shallow dihedral.

# Protection
Bolts with top rap anchors.
