# Description
It's worth doing, but usually has no chalk and not fixed. It starts up the ramp maybe 20' from Aggro monkey. Tackles a couple tough v6-7 boulder problems before joining Scene of the Crime right before the mono crux. I would recommend lowering down off of Scene of the Crime to chalk and brush holds if it looks like it hasn't received attention lately.

# Location
Direct start for Scene of the Crime. Scramble down to the base from above.... There is a bolt for a belayer to anchor in. Look for a flake bolted onto the wall about 20' up, this is where the route goes.

# Protection
Bolts. Bring your own draws
