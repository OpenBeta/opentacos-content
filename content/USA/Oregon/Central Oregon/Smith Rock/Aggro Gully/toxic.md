# Description
Toxic is short and sweet.  It's probably the steepest moderate climb at Smith Rock.  While the crux is somewhat height-dependant it's a dyno for virtually everybody.  The holds are enormous and the fall isn't bad at all, so fire with everything you've got!

The large jugs are a welcome change from the crimps and pockets that are found on most routes here.

Toxic can be found at the far left end of the left side of the Aggro Gully.  Belay from some large boulders at the base of the route.
