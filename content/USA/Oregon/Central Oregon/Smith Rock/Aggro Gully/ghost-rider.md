# Description
This is an old route that was bolted with Lag bolts in the late 80's. I recently re-bolted it and added a new anchor as well. The crux comes at a bulge near the top of the route. Very bouldery crux. Opinions vary as to the grade, 12b/c seems to be a good rating. Some loose rock is to be expected as it has not had many ascents. Enjoy!

# Location
First route at the entrance to Agro Gully.

# Protection
Bolts
