# Description
This is a fun power endurance problem.  It starts out with big moves on good holds through a steep bulge, enters a crimpy over-hanging boulder-problem, and finishes with some more jug wrangling on the final bulge.  The moves are fun and athletic, and the holds are comfortable, but don't appear to be excessively manufactured.

# Location
This the striking bulge at the top of the aggro-gully.  Scramble up the approach pitch to the base.  I would recommend roping up.

# Protection
Bolts
