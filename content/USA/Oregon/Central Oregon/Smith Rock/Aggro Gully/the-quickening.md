# Description
Amazingly this is one of the easier lines up the incredibly burly Agro Wall. At .12c with two distinct cruxes, a pumpy finish, and even a mantle, this route gives you full value. There are a few hollow-sounding jugs towards the top so be careful when you're yarding off of them during the final sprint to the chains.

I found the lower crux to be more strenuous than the upper one but locking off and stabbing for the pocket on the upper becomes pretty difficult if you're getting pumped. Well-bolted and clean falls.

# Location
Aggro Wall.  Belay from the bolt on the slab, being careful not to knock rocks down on the lower belay platforms.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  There are often 'draws hanging on this route.
