# Description
Climb the entire lower panel of Badman, including both cruxes.  Pull the small roof onto jugs and move up and left to the furthest left hueco.  Clip a shoulder length draw on the bolt up to the right (10th of Badman). From the hueco, move straight left, directly into the meat of Mama Daucus, executing a couple of tricky moves to reach the "Basketball." Fire through the crux of Mama Daucus and finish that route as normal.

# Location
Start on Badman, finish on Mama Daucus.

# Protection
Fixed draws.
