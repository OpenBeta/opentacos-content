# Description
Highway to Hell follows long pulls between slopey dishes and thin edges up a slightly overhanging panel of marginal rock.  The climbing is a bit off-balance as the line leans left, and the rock deriorates quite a bit near the top.  There are many better 5.12a's around, and this is likely the worst 12a in the Aggro Gully, but if you are desperate for morning shade, this doesn't see the sun until 2pm or so.

# Location
On the east side of the Aggro Gully, following the first line of bolts encountered when entering the gully, then heading left when the bolt-lines diverge (Ghost Rider heads right).

# Protection
~6 bolts to 2 Bolt Anchor.
