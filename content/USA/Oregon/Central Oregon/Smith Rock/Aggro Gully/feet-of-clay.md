# Description
Approach the first bolt of this route with an easy leftward traverse on creaky flakes.  The technical crux awaits you at the second bolt where you must decipher some tricky arete moves.  Once passed the arete make your way up right through some committing moves on overhanging jugs.  Enjoy the fun exposed moves!

# Location
This route is most easily approached from the start of "toxic" (aggro gully).  Your belayer may want to use the belay bolt, hidden behind a boulder, just to the left of the start of toxic.

# Protection
10 bolts, chains
