# Description
Very bouldery! Rarely repeated testpiece at the entrance of Aggro Gully. Start on Highway to Hell and bust left at the third bolt. Boulder through a  severe panel of tiny crimps and slopey pockets (v11/12 boulder problem?!?!) into a good undercling rest jug. Go up 3 more bolts and head right to finish. As more people get on it the rock quality will only improve.

# Location
Entrance of Aggro Gully. Starts on Highway to Hell, ends on Highway to Hell.

# Protection
Fixed quickdraws and Fixed Anchor.
