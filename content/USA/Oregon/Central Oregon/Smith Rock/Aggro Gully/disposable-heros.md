# Description
A good flow route with moderately difficult movement throughout. It begins by climbing the overhanging section of The Quickening, where you must traverse left on pumping jugs. You wont encounter a single stopper move, most plummet near the top on relatively decent holds.

You'll be tempted to climb to the right at the top, into The Quickening. Do not do this. Locals lower down in the gully will sneer and invalidate your ascent.

# Location
Upper right wall. Top of the slab.

# Protection
Bolts!
