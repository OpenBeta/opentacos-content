# Description
Monkey Boy features fun overhanging pulls between great jugs.  Its surprising that Crack Babies (12b) receives so much more traffic than this route.  If youre in search of an easy 12c, like big moves on good holds, and closely spaced bolts, then this route is for you.

Start by scrambling up a series of ledges to the first bolt.  Next climb a short funky slab to a bulge.  Then the jug hauling is on for about 15 feet.  Clip the final bolt and commit to a long left handed lunge to a one inch edge.  Thats the crux.  This route is tons of fun, and worth a try if you find yourself climbing Toxic.

Note: The Watt's guidebook indicates a hard to clip bolt.  Perhaps the bolt has been moved, because none of the clips are strenuous.

# Location
Monkey Boy lies 100 feet uphill from "Up for Grabs" on the east facing side of the gully.

# Protection
6 bolts and anchors.
