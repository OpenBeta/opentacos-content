# Description
Same start as White Wedding. Begin in a steep section utilizing large incuts. Clip the 4th and make a large move to a decent slopper 11+. Rest and enter the crux, a series of delicate pockets to some serious pebble pinching 13-. At the 3rd pebble move up and right to a good slot just above the roof, match and move your way up the second tier. After clipping grab yet another pebble and high step and scum your way to a nice slopping 4 finger pocket, stand up and grab the huge jug, rest. Make your way back left and finish out on the pumpy rail system, roughly 12b from there. Endurance and crimp strength are key to sending this rig.
