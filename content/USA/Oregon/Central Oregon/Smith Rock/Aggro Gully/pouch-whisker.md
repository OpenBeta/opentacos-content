# Description
This is a fun, "thoughtful" route.  The moves aren't hard, but they feel insecure, which adds to the entertainment.  Anchors appear to be glue-ins without epoxy?

# Location
Up at the top of the aggro gully, on the arette to the right of Kill My Hate

# Protection
Bolted, 5 bolts + 4 for the belay and top anchors
