# Description
Another great route in Aggro, this provides a nice contrast from the crimpy Planet Mechanic. Start on a juggy flake and head right to the first bolt. Good holds head up to bolt 4 where great pocket climbing under the roof. A tough move to a resting pocket allows you to catch your breath before the roof. An exciting and largely skin friendly sequence takes you over the roof to the anchors.

# Location
Uphill from Up For Grabs, Planet Mechanic, and Kiss Fight. It's the only line traversing left and through the roof.

# Protection
Currently outfitted with great hung gear.
