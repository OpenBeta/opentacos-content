# Description
Cool linkup between the first part of Badman and the end crux of White Wedding. Put a runner on the 6th bolt of Badman to cut right into white wedding. A little bit awkwardness to get into the start of the crux of White Wedding. It's fun, and very sustained. Hard for the grade.

# Location
Start on Badman and end on white wedding. Pretty simple, another Aggro gulley linkup

# Protection
Bolts. Since its Aggro it should be fixed
