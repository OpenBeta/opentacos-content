# Description
Short roof at beginning gives way to easier climbing to anchor. Not a bad climb but the hike doesnâ€™t warrant the trip unless your headed up there anyways. Heads up belay to the first and second bolt.

# Location
Second route on the large ledge system at the top right of aggro gully.

# Protection
5 bolts. Anchor. Attentive belayer.
