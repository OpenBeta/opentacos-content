# Description
After conquering

The Quickening

it's time to move on down to the serious stuff on this wall, and Aggro Monkey is the next logical step.  It's steep, it has some big lockoffs with desperate stabs to pockets, and it's always got quickdraws hanging enticingly.

This is what the Aggro Wall is all about-- pumpy, thuggish, and powerful moves with gorgeous position on good rock.
