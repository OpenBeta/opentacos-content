# Description
This thing is totally worth doing!

Wade through some brush at the base and climb delicately on fragile rock to a no hands ledge at the 3rd bolt, then tackle a fun and powerful boulder problem through the steep section. The headwall is moderate but pretty good, with some easily avoidable choss mixed in.

I reinforced all of the important holds through the boulder problem so it should be good to go for a while. Get on it!

# Location
On the main Aggro wall, just up the hill from The Quickening.

# Protection
7 bolts and some fat anchor rings.
