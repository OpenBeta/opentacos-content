# Description
This route tackles two distinctive cruxes: the start of Villain and a somewhat reachy, technical panel in character with everything else on the wall. Serves as a nice, short intro to Aggro Gully savagery.

Climb the horrible start of Villain. At the 5th bolt, just before the Villain crux panel, head right to the anchor of Highway to Hell.

# Location
