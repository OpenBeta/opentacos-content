# Description
Somewhat thin climbing through the first two clips leads to a small (and pretty fun) overhang move.  Keep climbing the featured rock to final pulling through finger pockets (or sidle around to the anchors from the right for a less challenging finish).

# Location
First line right of Rope de Dope Crack.

# Protection
5 bolts to bolted anchor.
