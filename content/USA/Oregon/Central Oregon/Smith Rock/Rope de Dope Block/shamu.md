# Description
Tricky and strenuous moves highlight this climb.  Given 5.8 in the 1992 guide, this route was listed at 5.9 in a posting  by Alan Watts on crag.com back in 1999.  A fun, short route that I'd give at the low end of 3 stars.

# Location
On the north side of the block.  It's the first route left of the NW corner

# Protection
8 Bolts to anchor.
