# Description
Slightly awkward moves at the start, easy climbing in the middle, and a fun crux at the top.  If you inexplicably find yourself climbing at the Rope-de-Dope block, this isn't a bad route to do.

# Location
Left side of the block, it now has its own independent anchor. Identify it with the big huecos that you pass through 1/3 to 1/2 way up.

# Protection
a reliable source tells me there are 8 bolts on this, leading to tap anchor
