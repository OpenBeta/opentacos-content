# Description
A short but very fun face climb 2 to the right of the 5.8 crack.  It used to be a TR, but now has bolts.  This is the center of 3 routes next to each other.

The crux is the lower half and involves some excellent sidepulls and gas pockets with smeary feet and 1 heel hook.  Very athletic for the grade.  Much better than Float Like A Butterfly.  Would be a 4 star route if it was twice as long.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
6 bolts with an 2 bolt anchor
