# Description
Originally rated 5.3X in the first edition of Watts' book, the second edition now rates this at 5.5R.  While not difficult, the lower moves are awkward enough that a rating above 5.3 seems warranted.  Poorly protected for trad climbing, but a good beginner route once a TR is established.  For the very small or very timid, one can "cheat" a bit by starting up and left of the crack, although this would likely downgrade the route back to the 5.3 range.

# Location
Furthest left route on the North (left) side of the block (left of "How Low Can You Go").  Start in the flaring crack and work your way up.

# Protection
Bolted with anchor
