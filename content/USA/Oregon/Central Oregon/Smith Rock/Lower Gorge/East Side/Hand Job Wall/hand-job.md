# Description
A tricky bouldering start is probably the crux of this route.  Good protection soon follows with stemming/jamming moves up a set of double cracks.  A very good route that I think borders on classic.

# Location
Hand Job Wall (on the east side of the Crooked River)

# Protection
Gear to 2 1/2 inches.
