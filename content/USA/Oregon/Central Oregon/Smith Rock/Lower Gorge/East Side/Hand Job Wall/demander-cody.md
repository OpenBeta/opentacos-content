# Description
Climb the start of Mines Of Moria (and Cody's Corner), but when you hit the top of the hole, tackle an intimidating undercling out left and swing into an aesthetic hand/finger crack in a shallow corner.  Finish at the same anchors as the Mines, Cody's Corner, and McKenzie's Way.

# Location
Shares the start with Mines of Moria and then climbs up the left corner.

# Protection
Finger sized cams to #2 camalot.  Pay attention to rope drag/gear placement in the undercling.
