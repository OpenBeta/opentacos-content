# Description
Start on the same column but to the right of Lost and Found. Starts in a weird cave formed with a boulder (I think you can just stand on top of the boulder). Some wide moves and fun to the anchors.

# Location
Start by the large boulder and cave next to Lost and Found

# Protection
Standard Rack a #4 might be useful
