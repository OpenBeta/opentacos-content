# Description
To the left of Demander Cody/Mines of Moria, a single bolt protects the crux, but otherwise has great gear.  Short but fun movement on super solid rock.

For the anchor, either traverse right or left at the top of the columns.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Gear to 2", bolt.

A single metolius purple 0 protects the start very well before you reach the bolt.  Can place from the top of a pillar if you are on the taller side.
