# Description
This bolted sport route starts with stemming and a crux low on the route. Some face climbing leads back to a stem problem crux up to the base of the roof. Pull the roof to the right and past another bolt to the anchor. Be aware that this route required a substantial cleaning but still it is a bit flakey on the lower part. It should clean up nicely with more traffic.

# Location
It is located on the Hand Job wall, just left of Ugly As Sin and right of Killer Jism.

# Protection
9 bolts and anchor
