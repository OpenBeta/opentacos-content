# Description
This route has probably been climbed but I didn't see it in any guidebooks. One of the most unique moves in the park. Climb up the big blocks to the right of Huckleberry Hound, then up the chimney and through the "sphincter" to climbers left and ends at the Huckleberry Hound and Lost and Found anchors.

# Location
Right of the big blocky tunnel/chimney to the right of Huckleberry Hound

# Protection
1 #3 or 3.5 protects the sphincter move.
