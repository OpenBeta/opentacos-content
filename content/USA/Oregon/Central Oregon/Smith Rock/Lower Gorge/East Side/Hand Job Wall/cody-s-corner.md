# Description
Climb up as for the start of Mines Of Moria.  When you hit the top of the hole, instead of climbing inside the chimney, swing around to the right side and continue up the outside in a nice fun stem-box with double cracks (this is also the top of McKenzie's Way).

# Location
Shares the start and anchors with Mines Of Moria.

# Protection
Finger sized cams up to #2 Camalot.  Pay attention to rope drag coming out of the hole and swinging around into the stem box.
