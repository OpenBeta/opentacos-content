# Description
A stout little sport climb, with tricky moves at almost every bolt.  The difficulties start immediately with an overhanging bulge at the first bolt.  Shallow stemming with a lot of holds facing the wrong ways continues through the mid-section until another overhang this time on jugs leads to the anchors.

My Friend... is good fun, it certainly doesn't feel like the easiest sport route in the Lower Gorge!
