# Description
Blitzkrieg is a handcrack to steep slanting off width. The hands section is perfect gold camalots for 2/3 of the route before you pull onto the guano pedestal and commit to the wide section.

This wide section, while only 5.9, will likely feel more difficult and definitely will feel more physical than the neighboring Original Sin.  The OW is a great test of 5.9 bigger than fist jamming skills, or you can always go with the technique of no technique and lay it back.

Easily toproped after leading Original Sin, as the two climbs share an anchor.

# Location
Right side of the Hand Job wall, right of Original Sin, shares anchors with Original Sin.

# Protection
Hand sized cams for the bottom half, gear to 4.5 for the OW.
