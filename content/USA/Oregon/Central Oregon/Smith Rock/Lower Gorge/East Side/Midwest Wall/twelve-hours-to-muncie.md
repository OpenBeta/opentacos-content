# Description
Climb splitter hands to face holds and fingers, then join the top of Detroit Rock City. Pull through a roof on jugs and follow the off-width to the top (you can easily climb face holds without doing OW moves).

# Location
This is the farthest upstream route on the East side of the Gorge, at the far right side of the Midwest Wall. Scramble onto some columns around the corner and you'll see the starting hand crack.

# Protection
fingers to 6 inches
