# Description
Climb up into the obvious curving off-width. Just when you are wondering how the heck this is 5.9 reach back over your shoulder and grab a jug on top of the arete. Pull through to easier holds and regroup before pulling the jugs through a buldge and finishing on the 6" OW up top (you can climb face holds past this top OW).

# Location
The obvious curving OW on the right side of the wall before you go around the corner.

# Protection
fingers to 6 inches
