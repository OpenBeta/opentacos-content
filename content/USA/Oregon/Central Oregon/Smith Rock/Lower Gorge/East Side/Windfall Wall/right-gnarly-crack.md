# Description
The right of two cracks in the extremely rough rock.  There is a oddly placed bolt.  Supposedly according to the Watts book neither this crack nor the Left Gnarly Crack have been led, but I'm not sure I believe that.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Cams/nuts, bolt
