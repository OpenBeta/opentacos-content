# Description
Start far to the left below Zealot (the 5.12 trad route), and do a long, wandering up and down traverse right to get into the fist crack to the left of Baby Walks.

Supposedly there is a poorly protected direct start that eliminates the traverse.

Has its own anchor, or a finish to the rim.

# Location
Two corners to the right of Fool's Pleasure, two corners to the left of Llama Momma.

# Protection
Pro to 4"
