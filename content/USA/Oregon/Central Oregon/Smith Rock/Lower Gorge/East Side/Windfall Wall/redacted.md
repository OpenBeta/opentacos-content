# Description
A very ignored routed but worth doing. Climbing is good, protects well, and there are some really memorable moves up high. It is slightly wandery, so make sure  you bring enough alpine draws to extend pieces.

# Location
Right in the corner where the bubbly rock starts to your right and clean columns to your left.

# Protection
Standard rack, nuts are useful. There are rappel anchors up top with steel biners.
