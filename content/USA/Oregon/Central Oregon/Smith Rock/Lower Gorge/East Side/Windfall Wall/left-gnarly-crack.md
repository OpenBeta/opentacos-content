# Description
The left of two cracks in the extremely rough rock.  There is a oddly placed bolt.  Supposedly according to the Watts book neither this crack nor the Right Gnarly Crack have been led, but I'm not sure I believe that.

# Location
A ways right of Mister Reach in the extremely rough rock.

# Protection
Cams/Nuts, bolt
