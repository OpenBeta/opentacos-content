# Description
A fun route if you enjoy the obscure.  Its not often climbed but there are some hard and memorable moves.  There is very little straight in crack climbing so the route feel more like a gorge sport climb than anything.  The route is a bit more serious that most 5.10 as the protection is specific and small in a few key spots.

The crux that comes at mid height can be a bit unnerving to pull as smaller gear protects while you transition out of the crack that has seamed out.

# Location
Right of Mr. Reach, Left of Genocide.  Scramble up the ledges to start the route.

# Protection
General I would say the protection on this route is trickier or more specific that most routes for the grade in the gorge, so come prepared with nuts, a few tiny cams, Doubles .3 BD to 1, Single 2 & 3. Tons of alpine draws 7+.

A crucial small nut can be placed from a ledge before you pull the first bouldery move to get established on the route (might be a stretch for shorter ppl)

A small nut/ball nut/tiny cam is necessary to protect the crux at mid height.
