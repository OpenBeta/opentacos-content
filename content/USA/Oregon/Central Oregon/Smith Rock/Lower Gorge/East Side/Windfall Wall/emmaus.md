# Description
The corner left of Zealot.  Start in the jungle and climb broken blocks to get to the crack.  The books says to hand traverse right after the columns, but then continue up to the rim-rock on junky easy climbing.  Looks like it might also be possible to keep traversing right into the same shared anchor above Margo's Madness, but I haven't done it myself.
