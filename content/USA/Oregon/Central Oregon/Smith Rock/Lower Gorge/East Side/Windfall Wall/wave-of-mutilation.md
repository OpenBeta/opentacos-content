# Description
Boulder through 20 feet of sidepulls and poor feet, then do a delicate foot move on a classic gorge ripple. Set up and toss into a jug with the third bolt in your face. Clip, and it's only about 10+ to the anchors. Watch out for the final clipping stance, as it's pretty tricky.

# Location
Windfall wall, one route left of Mr. Reach. It's the only bolted 12a on the east side.

# Protection
5 bolts and anchors, stick clip or french free your way to the second bolt. Also, because the belayer stands below the starting ledge, falling at the third bolt can be awkward if you swing across the rope. For this reason, I recommend clipping the first bolt with only a single biner to keep the rope as close to the wall as possible.
