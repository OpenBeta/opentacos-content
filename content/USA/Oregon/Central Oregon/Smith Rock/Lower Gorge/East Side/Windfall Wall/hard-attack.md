# Description
A spectacular route, itself worth a trip to the Windfall Wall. Thoughtful protection and movement characterize this route, like many of the gorge 5.11s. Climb a fingers to hand crack to a stance under the roof. Skirt left into a beautiful stem box, using your lower gorge trickery to make the small features useful for protection and upward progress. When the columns end,head up and right pulling wild steep moves up the cracked headwall to reach a two bolt anchor.

# Location
Left of "Wave of Mutilation", the farthest left bolted line. "Hard Attack" starts in a grey corner beneath a roof formed by a hanging column.

# Protection
Cams to 2.5", extra fingers and micro, 2-3 each of the smallest not unreasonable. Wires. RP's or Ballnuts useful (for TR'ing through the crux on lead)

Standard rack will apparently suffice for your average hard-person

Anchor has two Metolius rap hangers
