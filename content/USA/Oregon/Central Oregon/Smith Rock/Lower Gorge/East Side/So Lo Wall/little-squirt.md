# Description
This is the next route immediately to the right of Pipsqueak. Like its neighbour, it's pretty short but not a gimme for the grade.

# Location
Just to the right of Pipsqueak. Descend from a bolted rappel anchor.

# Protection
Standard rack. I used cams in the fingers to hand size range. Fixed rappel anchor at the top.
