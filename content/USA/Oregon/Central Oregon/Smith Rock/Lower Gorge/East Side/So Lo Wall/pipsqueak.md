# Description
This is the best looking and most distinctive line on the wall. Although it's quite short, it is a nice climb and might make a good, gentle introduction to steeper crack climbing.

# Location
This is towards the left side of the wall. Locate a very small roof low to the ground. This climbs the hand crack on the right side of the roof. After surmounting the hand crack trend up and right to a bolted rappel anchor.

# Protection
#2 Camalots. A #3 Camalot could be finagled in higher in the crack. Fixed rappel anchors.
