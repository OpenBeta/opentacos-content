# Description
Double cracks immediately left of the bolted route (Measure for Madness, 11d) left of Much Ado About Nothing. Climb to a small ledge then jam, stem, and chimney up to a small roof. Turn this, then find anchors just above the roof on climbers left.

The anchors are shared with As You Like It/Yost In Space.

The roof and headwall make this one of the best 5.9's at Smith.

# Location
Lower Gorge, East Columns, across the river from

Cruel Sister

.

# Protection
A few big cams (up to BD #4) could be useful but not necessary.
