The clean and varied crack just to the right of Much Ado About Nothing. Atop the crack, muscle through the rimrock crux, clearing a small roof on big holds. Original finish traverses out left to the rap anchor of Much Ado.

# Location
Just to the right of Much Ado About Nothing. Look for a set of bolted anchor underneath the obvious roof at the cliff, this is the line to the right of that.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5"
