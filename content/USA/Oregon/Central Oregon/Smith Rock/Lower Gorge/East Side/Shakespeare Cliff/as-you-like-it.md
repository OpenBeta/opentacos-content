# Description
Yet another fun hand and finger crack...

On the Shakespeare Cliff start up the left side of the cliff on top of a large flat block.

Follow a great jam crack in a shallow left facing corner to a tricky crux.

Gain a ledge and then power through a final bulge on jugs to an anchor.

Best to belay from above and rap off.

# Location
left side of Shakespeare cliff.

# Protection
rack from .5" - 2.5"
