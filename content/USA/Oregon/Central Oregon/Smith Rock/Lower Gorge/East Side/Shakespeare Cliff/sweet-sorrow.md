# Description
Sweet Sorrow climbs the arete of the column to the right of Two Gentlemen's Pneumonia.  I spied this line in late January 2015 and put it up early February.  The left face was pretty lichen covered, and I pretty much ruined a stiff brush getting the lichen off the arete.  Its pretty clean and very climbable now.

Start on the right crack and climb ~15' past a single bolt to a big ledge that you can easily stand on.

From the ledge, reach up and clip the 2nd bolt.  A crux sequence pulls off the ledge past the 2nd bolt and around the arete to the left.  Climb really cool and enjoyable .10+ arete moves past 3 more bolts to the top of the column.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
5 bolts, 2 bolt anchor with rings on the top of the column.
