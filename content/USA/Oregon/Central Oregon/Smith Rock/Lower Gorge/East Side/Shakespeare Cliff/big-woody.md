# Description
A great hands to thin hands crack.  Definitely worth doing.

# Location
Follow the line on the left side of the inverted tooth column.

# Protection
Gear to 3''  Sling anchor well before the rim at logical end of consistent climbing so you don't have to top out.  Although the anchor looks questionable I lived to tell the tale.
