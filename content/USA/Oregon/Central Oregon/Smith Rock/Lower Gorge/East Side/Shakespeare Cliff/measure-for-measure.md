# Description
A fun start pulling over the roof gets harder as you climb up. The route starts working the left side of the arete but works both sides as the column narrows at the top. The crux comes at the 2nd to last bolt where blank arete slapping and lousy feet lead to a desperate clipping hold. Looking for others input so we can get this route information more accurate

# Location
Bolted arete in the middle of the wall

# Protection
Bolts the whole way up.  Shares anchors with Much to Do about Nothing.
