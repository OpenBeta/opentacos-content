# Description
A bolted face/arete route with the independent anchor. Start with pulling the roof at the first bolt. Moderate face climbing leads to technical lieback moves, then back to face climbing. You can protect between 7th and 8th bolt with yellow Metolius cam, where the left crack comes into the route. A final powerful move leads to the anchor.

# Location
Located between Puck and Othello on the column/face with a roof start.

# Protection
Bolts. One 3/4" cam useful. Anchor with chains.
