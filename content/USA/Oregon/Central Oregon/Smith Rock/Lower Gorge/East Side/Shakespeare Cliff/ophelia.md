# Description
You're supposed to move to the right at the roof/bulge at the top to find an anchor, but we went straight over the bulge direct to use the anchor above Othello.

# Location
Just to the right of Azog lies a pair of flaring cracks.

# Protection
There are rap rings to the left and the right of the top of this route, but neither where you'd most want them to reduce rope drag.
