# Description
Climb a short finger crack to a brief off-finger/thin hand crux at mid height. Jam your way up to a big ledge with a rap anchor to the right, or continue up the rimrock dihedral (may require walk off). Watch out for loose rocks on the ledge.

# Location
Just to the right of Off Tempo, a few feet right of a rectangular 10-foot block. The short thin crack is the most attractive line in this section of the crag.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5"
