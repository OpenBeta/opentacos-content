# Description
Start by jamming a thin hand crack at a lower column, then scramble up a section of broken rock band to the base of the intimidating dihedral. Place some gear and fire the overhanging rimrock on good jams and jugs, the exposure the incredible! Walk off or rap on a bolt + nut.

# Location
On the right side of Arrington Columns, just uphill from Shakespeare Cliff. A wide looking crack that splits the roof is obvious. Climb the clean crack directly below that line.

# Protection
Gear to 3"
