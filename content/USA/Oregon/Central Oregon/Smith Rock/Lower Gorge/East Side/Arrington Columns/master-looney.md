# Description
This unusual Lower Gorge route starts with a 10b crack broken up with horizontal seams leading to a rest in a "cave" inset.  From here you clip a bolt and then launch into strenuous roof moves leading to the top.

# Location
Arrington Columns (North side of the Crooked River)

# Protection
Gear to 2 1/2 inches.  One bolt protecting the roof, with additional optional gear placements possible above this.
