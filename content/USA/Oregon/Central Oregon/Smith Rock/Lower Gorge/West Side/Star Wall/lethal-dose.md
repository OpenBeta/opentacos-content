# Description
Makes a great top rope from Mantra with a directional piece.  Pretty hard moves for .11a.  The guide book makes it sound like a POS, but you won't be disappointed with a Top rope.

# Location
Crack just right of Mantra

# Protection
Top Rope or some small specific cams and offset nuts.
