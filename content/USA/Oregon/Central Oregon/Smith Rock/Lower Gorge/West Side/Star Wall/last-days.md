# Description
A great route with solid gear.  Most of the route is simple laybacking, jamming, and jug hauling, with only a few tricky moves at the start.

Watts recommends moving right to anchors, but the anchors to the left worked for us, and were chains instead of ratty slings.  Also, we had the chance to tr Levitate, which is worth a few minutes of your time.

# Location
Left of Little Wing, and right of Levitate in the Star Wall area.  Perhaps most recognizable for the  heavily chalked triangular-blocky hold about ten or fifteen feet up in the corner.

# Protection
Mostly thin gear, but there are a couple spots for cams up to 1 - 1.5".  Overprotect the start: it's the crux, and it would be easy to botch and groundfall without careful gear placement.
