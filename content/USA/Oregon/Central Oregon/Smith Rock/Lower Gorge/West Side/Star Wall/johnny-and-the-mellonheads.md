# Description
All the pins have been replaced with bolts. A new anchor has been added instead of sharing anchors with Neutron Star. The new finish is longer, a bit run out, but the difficulties ease quickly. There are a few 5.12 sections on this route. One comes low on gear, the other comes at the first bolt.

# Location
The route is just left of Neutron Star.

# Protection
Small trad gear and quick draws. Gear and 3 bolts. Starts and finishes on gear.
