# Description
Technical and varied climbing on a column past eight bolts leads to the upper crack section of Morning Star. The crux comes between bolt #3 and #4. Reaching bolt #8 is somewhat contrived because you have to consciously avoid using the Morning Star crack on your right. The climbing quality, however, is excellent.

# Location
The bolted column adjacent to Morning Star on the Star Wall.

# Protection
QD's and optional gear to 0.5" for the upper crack portion of Morning Star. Beefy chain anchors are at the top.
