# Description
Another killer stem line in the Lower Gorge! Thin, but doable moves open things up after which the difficulty slowly builds. The crux comes high on the route moving past a flare protected by bolts followed by a wild move to a jug.

# Location
In between Cry of the Gerbil and Neutron Star.

# Protection
Thin. Bring lots of 00 and 0 Metolius sized cams and your quiver of RPs. 0-2 Metolius cams for the opening finger crack. There are bolts at the top.
