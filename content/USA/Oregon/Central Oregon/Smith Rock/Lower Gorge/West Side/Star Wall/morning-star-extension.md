# Description
Extension for Morning Star.  Continue up to the right past the Morning Star anchors.  Follow a thin crack for 15 ft then traverse left and up through the final steep section.  Easier climbing to a large ledge just below the rim.  Use a 70 m rope to lower to the ground.  Tie a knot in the end of the rope a 70 just reaches.  (planning on moving the anchors down lower at some point....)

# Location
Lower with 70m rope or two raps with 60m using Morning Star anchor as intermediate.

# Protection
I added 3 bolts to the route.  It seemed like a needed enhancement.  Still bring .5 to protect the last move if the bolt just down the right of of you is too far away.  Also a # 1 or 2 BD cam will protect the easy 5.7 scramble to the anchors.

If you want to do it all trad: Bring small nuts and cams to protect the lower section, a .5 purple BD fits nicely as you pull the last bulge at the crux.
