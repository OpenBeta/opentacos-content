# Description
Mantra Extension stacks 50 feet of overhanging terrain atop the existing classic, Mantra.

Sometimes grainy and a little spicy, it has adequate gear and breathtaking position.

This is likely the steepest 5.10 at Smith Rock.Â  It deserves way more repeats than it gets.

# Location
Climb Mantra, then angle up and right through a triple roof system.

# Protection
Stoppers and a single set of cams from yellow Metolius to a #3 Camalot, in addition to the usual rack for Mantra.  Bolted anchor.  Lower off with a 70m rope.  Probably too long for a 60.
