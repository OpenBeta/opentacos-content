# Description
A fun wide crack between Catalyst and Southern Cross in a big corner. Not too much wide technique necessary until the last few moves. Bring your biggest pieces.

# Location
between Catalyst and Southern Cross; just left of the classic Cruel Sister. Has chain anchors but no hooks/ biners.

# Protection
big, nothing smaller than 0.3 necessary.
