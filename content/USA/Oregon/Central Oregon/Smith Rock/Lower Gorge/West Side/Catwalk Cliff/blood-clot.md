# Description
Blood Clot is fun climb that would be more noteworthy if its location were further away from the spectacular

Cruel Sister

.

It is generally considered easier than

Cruel Sister

for some with a more difficult crux section.  Still it is a very nice climb that takes takes great pro.

# Location
This climb lies just to the right of

Crack-A-No-Go

and to the left of a pidgeon-shit covered ledge.  Bolted anchors allow convenient lowering.

# Protection
Nuts and Cams to #3 camalot.
