# Description
This is a stellar route with good rock and varied climbing. Setting up under the roof is awkward, and then the first roof packs quite a punch. Around the 3rd bolt you get to a really unique jug that allows for a traverse onto the column. The technical climbing continues all the way to the second roof, better hope there's chalk up there!!

# Location
3 sport route of the Catwalk Columns, make sure your not climbing Strike Force which has a few boots low then trad gear.

# Protection
8 bolts to an anchor, all in great shape as of 2015
