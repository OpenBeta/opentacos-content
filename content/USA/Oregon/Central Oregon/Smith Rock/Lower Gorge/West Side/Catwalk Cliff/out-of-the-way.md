# Description
Out of the Way is a second pitch or extension to the existing route, Old and in the Way.

Climb Old and in the Way to a new anchor (10d trad) at a good ledge.  An easy scramble up and left leads to increasingly steep moves protected by four bolts, to an anchor with steel 'biners.   If linking from the ground, a

70m rope will just barely get you back down.  Tie a knot in the end.

Breaking it into two pitches will help minimize ledge fall potential.

# Location
Above Old and in the Way, a couple columns left of Cruel Sister.

# Protection
Bring doubles on small gear down to #0 Metolius for Old and in the Way.  Out of the Way has four bolts with no other gear required.
