# Description
This amazing finger crack scares some with its sharp edges.  The route goes up a wide dihedral on locking finger jams and smearing feet.  The crux is trusting your feet on the small waves of basalt.  Its more endurance than power.  Not to be missed!!

# Location
Last Chance can be found at the right side of the narrow catwalk above the river.

# Protection
Nuts and cams to a #2 camalot with extra in the finger sizes.
