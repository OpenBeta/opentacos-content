# Description
Bat Soup is a four bolt extension to either Bat Flake or Pet Semetery.

The best approach clips the first three bolts of Pet Semetery before stepping left into the gear protected finger crack of Bat Flake. Â From the stance atop Bat Flake, launch into bolt protected moves through steep corners and good holds to an anchor with steel 'biners.

It takes all of a 60m rope to lower back to the ground.

# Location
Directly above Bat Flake and just left of the Pet Semetery anchor.

# Protection
Bring a handful of pieces from .3 to .75 Camalot and at least 7 draws for bolts.
