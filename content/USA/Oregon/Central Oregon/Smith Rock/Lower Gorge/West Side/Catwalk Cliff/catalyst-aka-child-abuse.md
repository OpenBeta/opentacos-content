# Description
A continuous onslaught of challenging moves lead to a thin crux just before the anchors.  Catalyst climbs like a continuous series of intriguing boulder problems broken by ledge rests.  As a (sport) classic in its own right, it however feels to me to be a bit close to the ultra-classic

Cruel Sister

(trad) on the right.

# Location
Catwalk cliff (south side of the Crooked River).  On the collumn just left of

Cruel Sister

.

# Protection
Bolts.
