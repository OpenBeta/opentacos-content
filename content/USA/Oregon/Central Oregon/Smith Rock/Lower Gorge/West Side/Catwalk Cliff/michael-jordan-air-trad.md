# Description
You have mastered the Full Court Press, now it's time to get some air!  This steep bouldery addition will get your heart pumping with powerful moves over small gear.  After FCP climb up to a pedestal and take a break.  From here I climbed up and put some gear in then climbed back down to rest before sending like Mike.  Don't forget to stick you tongue out.

# Location
Rise above Full Court Press (extension to full court press).

# Protection
From a stance just below the business I put in a purple as high as I could get it, two equalized No. 2 ball nuts and a double zero C3.

3-4 more cams in the purple to yellow metolius size round out the extension rack.
