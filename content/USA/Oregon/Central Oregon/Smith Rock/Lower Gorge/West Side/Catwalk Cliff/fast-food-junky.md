# Description
Jam the left crack and stem your way to the roof. You can then go left for easier moves, or right for a slightly harder finish. Note that going left will entail a traverse across to the anchor, which is on the right.

# Location
Second-to-last anchor on the Catwalk Columns before Wildfire. Look for the inset above a shorter column.

# Protection
Gear to 4"
