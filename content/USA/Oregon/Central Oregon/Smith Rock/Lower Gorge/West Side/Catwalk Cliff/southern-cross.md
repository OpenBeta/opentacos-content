# Description
Southern Cross is a spectacular line on great rock.  It's difficulties are compounded with spicy runouts on your smallest gear.  The insipient crack no longer contains bushes but also no longer has a fixed pin.

# Location
This route is to the left of the wide and nasty Taxdor.  It shares anchors with a sport climb to its left.

# Protection
While you may get in pro up to a #3.5 camalot be sure to bring triples of the smaller than finger size cams.  Offset nuts and micro stoppers will come in handy too.
