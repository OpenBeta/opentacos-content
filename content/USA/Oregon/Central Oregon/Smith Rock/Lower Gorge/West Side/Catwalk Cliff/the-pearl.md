# Description
A true gem amoung cracks.  The pearl is hard for the grade but one of the finest cracks of the gorge seams.  This seam has multiple hard section with a funky crux up high moving through a small roof.  Above the crux the climbing eases but the climbing becomes runnout.

# Location
The route is located to the left of a wide crack on the narrow catwalk.

# Protection
Bring a full selection of gear to a #3 camalot with extras in the smaller sizes.  I found an offset alien and red loweball comforting at the crux and above.
