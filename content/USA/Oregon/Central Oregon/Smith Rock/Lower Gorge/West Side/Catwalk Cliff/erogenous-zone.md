# Description
Hard moves off the ground protected by a bomber stopper lead to fun jams and some weird stems and smears up high.  Can either clip the first anchor on quasar or continue up and clip the second.  If you continue up be prepared for insecure smears and stems (not in the stem box though) with smaller gear.  Bring a few runners.  Great route and I don't see why it doesn't get more traffic

# Location
Just to the left of quasar.  Easily top-roped from those anchors, but very fun to lead as well

# Protection
Pretty sure i used one of every piece from BD purple C3 all the way to number 1.  Small gear seemed crucial if clipping the upper anchor.
