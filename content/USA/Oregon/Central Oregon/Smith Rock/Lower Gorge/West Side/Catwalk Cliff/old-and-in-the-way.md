# Description
This 2-star route is typical of the Lower Gorge (my experience anyway):  distinct curxes but not sustained (as opposed to 3- & 4-star lines).  The first crux hits at the very bottom as you try to establish yourself in either a stem position or with both feet in the flared handcrack pod.  Good rest awaits on ledge 15 feet up.  Above, layback and/or stemming brings you to the upper crux:  delicate stemming into another 6" wide pod.  Once you get your feet in it, you've essentially done the route.  Easier terrain (~5.8) brings you to anchors (on right side) atop Patent Leather Pump.

# Location
West side of Lower Gorge on Catwalk Cliff immediately left of Patent Leather Pump (which in turn is 50 feet left of Cruel Sister).

# Protection
Set of cams from smallest (black Alien or 00 TCU) to #2 Camalot.  Double black Aliens (for me anyway), double yellow Aliens and double on #0.5 Camalots.
