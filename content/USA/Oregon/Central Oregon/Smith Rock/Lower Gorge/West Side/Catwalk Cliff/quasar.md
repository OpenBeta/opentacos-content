# Description
This route lies immediately left of Ground Zero and about 30 feet right of Cruel Sister. Climb juggy rock for about 15 feet to the first gear opportunity. From here follow the finger and hand crack, with the crux coming early on. Most folks stop at the first set of anchors.

# Location
This route lies immediately left of Ground Zero and about 30 feet right of Cruel Sister. The frothy rock that makes up the start of the climb makes it easy to find.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5 inches. Small cams (up to Yellow TCU or Green Alien) are pretty useful.
