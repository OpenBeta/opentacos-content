# Description
Although the Lower Gorge features some of the best crack climbs on basalt in the U.S., Full Court Press is an example of one of the many  exceptional sport climbs there. As the name implies, the climbing is sustained from the onset. There are many difficult moves with the most powerful being a "cross through" at bolt#3.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Quick Draws and an optional TCU (blue - orange) or equivalent cam after the final bolt in the seam below the rap anchors. As admonished by A. Watts, stick clipping the first bolt is a wise move.
