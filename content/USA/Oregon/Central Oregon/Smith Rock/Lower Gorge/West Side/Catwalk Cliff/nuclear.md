# Description
Nuclear is a decent quality mixed route. Start with some box stemming on gear and bolts, which then transitions to a flare just before the textured rock. Pull onto the textured rock with some difficult and then keep it together on the traverse over to the last bolt of Full Court Press and clip that route’s anchor.

# Location
Between Full Court Press and the Pearl, starts off a ledge heading towards black painted Metolius hangers.

# Protection
5 bolts, 4-6 cams or nuts from Purple Metolius to Orange Metolius.  Consider stick clipping the first bolt, the gear prior mainly prevents a tumble off of the start, you could still hit the ledge you step off of.
