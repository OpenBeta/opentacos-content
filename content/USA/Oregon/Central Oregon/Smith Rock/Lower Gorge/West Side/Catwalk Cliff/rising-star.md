# Description
Given two stars in the Watts guide, this route is a bit of neglected classic.  Mellow jamming up a shallow left facing corner leads to an engaging sequence turning a roof.  Above that long lock-offs on positive locks take you to the chains.

# Location
3-4 lines right of Quasar.  Look for two roofs immediately left of Pet Cemetery.  Rising Star climbs the left most corner under the roofs.

# Protection
Gear to #2 C4.
