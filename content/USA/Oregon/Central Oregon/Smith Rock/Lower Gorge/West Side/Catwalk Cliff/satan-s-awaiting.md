# Description
This route feels hard for the grade, probably because all of the 11b climbing is packed into two moves.  Easy climbing up terrain shared with Bat Flake ends at a stem rest below the second roof.  Get ready to grit your teeth and try hard for the next ten feet.  After pulling through the crux to a stance, easy climbing leads to the chains. (shares an anchor with Rising Star)

# Location
In Between Rising Star (L) and Bat Flake/Pet Semetary. (R)

# Protection
Gear to 1.5"
