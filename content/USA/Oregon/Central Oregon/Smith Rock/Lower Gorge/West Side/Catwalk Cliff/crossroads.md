# Description
This is the first fully bolted line on the Catwalk. The first bolt is just above the broken rock, after which the route follows an undulating column of basalt. Its slightly heady between 2nd and 3rd bolt but gear is not required. Expect the typical intellectual basalt climbing in the area, with stems, mantels, slopers, edges, and pockets.

# Location
First bolted route in the Catwalk area.
