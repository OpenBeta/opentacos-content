# Description
Immediately right of Pet Cemetary and left of Full court press, Baby fit is a neglected classic.  Equally as good as many 11s and 12s in the gorge.  Begin with 2 bolts and thought provoking stems, smears, and face holds.  above the 2nd bolt you have to commit to getting to a good flake feature and the start of the gear (mostly nuts).  easy climbing follows 2 or 3 pieces of gear and situates you below 3 bolts and the back to back cruxes.

Figure out which holds you'd like to use and in what order and execute a stout sequence to a good hold.  In the frothy rock another crux awaits before the easier climbing to the top.  one last piece of gear can be placed above the last bolt.

This is an easy TR from Pet cemetery as well

# Location
Left of Full Court Press and right of Pet Cemetery

# Protection
bolts, a few stoppers, and I used a purple C3 in the flare up high
