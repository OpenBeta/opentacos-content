# Description
Interesting jamming up an undulating handcrack brings you to a vertical, very rough crack that goes from 2" to nothing.  Most will reach out right and use the upper crack of Religious Fervor.

# Location
Just left of the obvious wide crack start of Religious Fervor.

# Protection
Gear to 3"
