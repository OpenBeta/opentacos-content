# Description
This thin seam just right of

Cruel Sister

probably gets TR'ed more than any route in the gorge.  Although the copious amounts of chalk on this route make it less asthetic it is still an elegent line that makes for a worthy endeavor.

The crux is more cryptic than difficult and finding the right pro can be dubious too.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
A regular rack of cams and nuts should be complimented with mirco nuts, extras in the smallest cam sizes, and perhaps even a few offset nuts and cams

The route shares anchors with

Cruel Sister
