# Description
A tricky start leads to some good jamming as you ascend.  Just when you think it's over, it's not.

Once the crack is over with, a traverse up and left with little to no protection leads to the anchors.

# Location
2 bolt anchor.  Also the anchor for Greasy Spoon, Sitting Duck, and Religious Fervor

# Protection
Pro to 3"
