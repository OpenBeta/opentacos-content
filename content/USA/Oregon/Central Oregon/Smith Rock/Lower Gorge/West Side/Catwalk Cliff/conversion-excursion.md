# Description
Scramble 10 ft up and past a large bush to the start. This climb features two converging cracks that range from fat fingers to roughly the fist -> off-width transition.

# Location
Conversion Excursion sits in between "Old and in the way" and "On the spot". The anchor slings are visible from the start directly in-line with the climb. The two converging cracks which meet about 6 ft above the start help distinguish this route.

# Protection
Gear from 0.5 - #3 or possibly #4

A slung boulder is being used as the anchor, but the cord and webbing shows signs of wear and UV damage as of 3/25/18. Chained anchors can be accessed by traversing 20 ft left.
