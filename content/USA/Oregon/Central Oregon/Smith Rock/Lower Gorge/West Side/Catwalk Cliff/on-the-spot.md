# Description
The route starts at the base of a large flaked off boulder forming an off-width crack that offers little pro. Climb to the top of the boulder and lean out left to make an awkward transition to a hand crack. 20 ft of 5.8 climbing leads to a large ledge. Head right where a body sized off-width crack or a facey 5.8 fissure both lead to chained anchors.

# Location
Head left from 'Conversion Excursion' and walk between two large boulders. An off-width crack containing 2 large chock stones marks the start.

# Protection
Gear from 0.5 - #3

The start can be protected by slinging a very solid chock stone about 8 ft up. Avoid the lower chock-stone as it is loose. Alternatively, the start can be bypassed by scrambling up the backside of the boulder.
