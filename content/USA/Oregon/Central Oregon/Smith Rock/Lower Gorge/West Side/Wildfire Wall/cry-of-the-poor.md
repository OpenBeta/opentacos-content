# Description
A fun an varied route that keeps you mentally engaged.  A funky move at a horizontal down low and a thin crux at about mid height offer two good challenges to go with the sustained movement  This is one of the classic well protected 11a's in the gorge.

# Location
left of Lion of Judah, look for the chalked up horizontal fracture down low just above the pumice rock start.

# Protection
small gear primarily, wires, off-set nuts, micro cams to 2"
