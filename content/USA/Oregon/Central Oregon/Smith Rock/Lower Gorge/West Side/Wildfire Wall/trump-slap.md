# Description
Make the gorge great again! Begin by climbing Come to the Quiet until you reach the big ledge just right of that route's anchor.  Step right off the ledge and climb past 3 bolts on the nice arete, saving some juice for the Trump slap awaiting you.  Even the Donald himself would encourage you to scale this wall!

# Location
Left of Jessie's Line.

# Protection
Small gear from Metolius 0-4 and a BD #4 for Come to the Quiet and 3 bolts on the arete.  A slight runout from the last bolt to the anchor keeps the character of Jessie's Line intact, but the last few moves to the chains are quite easy.
