# Description
The improbable looking face right of Bold Line.  Begin with the first bolt clipped and immediately start into the delicate, yet powerful crux.  Summon your Shaolin mind control and command your feet to the blank wall as you slap up the arete.  Next, battle two tiny pockets, one so sharp it would bring a single tear to Hattori Hanzo's eye.  Float left to the slot hold at the second bolt where you meet up with Body Karate.  Congratulations, you've just mastered the most difficult climbing in the Lower Gorge; now continue sparring your way to the chains on the 2nd hardest route.

# Location
Directly right of the start to Bold Line/Body Karate.

# Protection
8 bolts to chains
