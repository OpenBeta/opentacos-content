# Description
This one's a gem! Varied movement on perfect rock with protection that sometimes makes you take note of your position, but usually is exactly where you want it.

Chimney up on top of the pillar at the base of Titus (bolts) and mantle on top to contemplate the climbing above.  Difficult, but doable climbing on sparse (but safe) protection brings you to good gear and fun fingerlocks in a corner.  After the fingercrack pinches off, enjoy delicate stemming, arete pinching, and compression moves all the way to the chains.  Awesome climbing!

# Location
Right of Pure Palm.

# Protection
Gear to 1", QDs.
