# Description
Multiple technical moves on small holds and insecure feet is the theme of this classic route. Try To Be Hip starts on the trad route, Out of Darkness.  Clip one bolt and reach a crack (can place an optional piece) before veering left to clip the second bolt. Mantle onto the column and continue with a few easier moves before getting slammed with continuous challenging thin moves.  While given 12a in the Watts guide, I think it deserves 12b.

# Location
Wildfire Wall on the south side of the Crooked River.

# Protection
Bolts with rap anchors at the top.  Optional gear piece (I think I used a .75 C3) in the crack above the first bolt.  While you could ground before the 2nd clip, the climbing is easy and the piece isn't really necessary.  The first bolt protects a bulge move to the crack.
