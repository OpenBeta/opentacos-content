# Description
This colorful route had fallen dusty by the time we had found it. Our start was essentially right between the two noted in Watts's Guidebook, about 3 ft left of first bolt. Head up to a lieback feature, which can be chimneyed.  Good edges pull onto the first face until bolt 3 or 4, where a strenuous mantel allows you to traverse right into the corner.  If you can get through the first few moves in the corner it gets progressively easier finishing on fantastic patina-like jugs. Like any true 11d at Smith expect solid 5.12 climbing(about as hard as White Trash or T2BH), but the intimidating climbing under the first bolts deters many.

# Location
Bolt line between White Trash and Just Say No/Try to Be Hip

# Protection
8 bolts to two brand new (2014) anchor bolts. Stick clip required.
