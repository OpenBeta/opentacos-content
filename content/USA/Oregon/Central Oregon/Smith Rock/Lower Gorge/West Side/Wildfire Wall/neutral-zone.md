# Description
Easy climbing up the opening dihedral eventually leads to a small roof created by a hanging column. Step right around the roof on good holds and commit to the thin corner above.  Expect the usual blend of sequency, insecure stemming and small gear typical of Lower Gorge 5.11.

# Location
In between Iron Cross (R) and Badfinger (L)

# Protection
Gear 3" (heavy on the thin cams and RPs)
