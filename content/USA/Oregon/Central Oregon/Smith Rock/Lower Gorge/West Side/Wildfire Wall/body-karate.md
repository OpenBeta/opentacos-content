# Description
You're going to need physical and mental agility for this one! Start up the first 10-15 feet of Bold Line with a high stick clip, follow a row of crimps right to a slot and the second bolt. From here, the next 30 feet of climbing are deceptively pumpy and all the holds face the wrong direction. At the roof, move left and clip the bolt on Bold Line before a good rest. With your wits about you, pull left out of the rest immediately onto a compression column. Multiple technical cruxes highlight the next few bolts of climbing, and reasonable holds disappear just in time to create some of the most complex and wild sequences in the Lower Gorge. Finish up easy terrain to a high set of fixed steel biners on a ledge.

# Location
Starts on Bold Line, right of Rescusitation.

# Protection
9 bolts, fixed steel biners at anchor. Stick clip the first bolt.
