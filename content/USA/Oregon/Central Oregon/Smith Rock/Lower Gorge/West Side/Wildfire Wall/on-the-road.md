# Description
The technical crux hits soon after the start with a thin crack through a bulge that is finger size dependent.  Larger fingers  require face moves while smaller fingers can use the thin crack. Fighting the pump to the finish is the other crux of this classic route.  A great climb.

# Location
Wildfire Wall

# Protection
Gear to 2 1/2 inches including small cams.
