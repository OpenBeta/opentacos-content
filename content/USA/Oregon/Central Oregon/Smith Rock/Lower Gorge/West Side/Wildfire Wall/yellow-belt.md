# Description
The second easiest way to this anchor, hence the name. Climb the continuously bouldery lower 5 bolts of Body Karate to the no-hands rest. From there, go straight up on the upper half of Bold Line. Climbing an easy 5.10 handcrack sure feels nice when your alternatives on either side are 5.12s with heinous cruxes!

# Location
Just right of White Trash - shares the start with Body Karate, but then follows the path of least resistance up the crack.

# Protection
Bolts for the first half, #2 - #4 Metolius cams for the second half
