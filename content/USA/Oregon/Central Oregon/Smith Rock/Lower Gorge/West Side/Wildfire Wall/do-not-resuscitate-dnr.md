# Description
You might want to sign a DNR before attempting the onsight of this one! Fun gorge stemming gives way to big moves on positive face holds at a midway transition into a shallow corner system left of Resuscitation. While the route takes ample safe gear, it is small, specific, and missing any placement in the first 40 feet will likely commit the climber to irreversible moves in no fall territory.

Listed as 36. Project (5.12?) in the Watts guide, this route was previously abandoned because "there's reason to believe that a hanging column the size of a couple Coke Machines might fall out someday."

Rather than getting anywhere near the sketchy column, this route breaks right into a shallow corner system and good face holds at about mid height. A new set of anchors has been added to accomodate the position of the new finish.

# Location
Between Resuscitation and White Trash. Break right before the hanging column.

# Protection
Minimum one set each DMM brass offsets and ballnuts #1-#3. Doubles in both would not go unappreciated. A single set of normal wires and C3's gives ample options and covers the most confidence inspiring placements.
