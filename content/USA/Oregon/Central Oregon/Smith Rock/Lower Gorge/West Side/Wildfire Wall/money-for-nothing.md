# Description
"We've got to move these refrigerators, we've got to move these color TVs."

-Dire Straits

Climbing the column between Pure Palm and Cornercopia feels much like trying to move a refrigerator.  Although this route is a bit pinched between these other classic lines and does share some holds, the climbing is totally independent and provides another great compression challenge to the Lower Gorge.

# Location
The column between Pure Palm and Cornercopia.

# Protection
8 bolts
