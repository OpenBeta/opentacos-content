# Description
A fun change of style from the lower Cry of the Poor.  Some big exposed moves up high on great rock make this a quality finish.  The finishing top sequence can be done one a few different ways...look around and don't be shy of the exposure.  Shorter climbers may find it a bit harder.

Extend the draw on the anchor of cry of the poor and the first bolt, otherwise rope drag will be an issue.  Make sure you bring enough draw to finish especially if you like to place nuts on Cry of the Poor.  Use a 70m to lower, tie a knot in the ends as it just reaches.

# Location
Straight up and right from the top of Cry of the Poor anchors.

Or up and left from the top of Lion of Judah (which might be the more aesthetic way to do it)

# Protection
6 Bolts plus anchors.
