# Description
A great climb that deserves more attention, some very memorable moves.  It is a little heads up climbing at the start for 15 ft where gear is tricky but otherwise protects really well.  Some of the crack is hard to see from the ground so it looks a little more run out than it actually is.

Bomber .2 BD x4 placement 15 ft up behind a nice clipping hold.  Placement hard to see from the ground and also while climbing.  You can breath a bit easier once you get this piece in.

# Location
Is right of Resuscitation, Shares a start with Bold line.

# Protection
Doubles from 00 to .75 camalot.  (You can sew it up with triples in several sizes)  Off set nuts are nice in a few key spots.  Ball nuts can also come in handy but not necessary.
