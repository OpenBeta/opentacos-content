# Description
Another variation that starts up Body Karate, but this time, from the no hands rest, head right onto the hanging column. Get a good stance on the column, and then launch into the crux - slappy compression climbing with terrible, smeary feet! After the crux, easy climbing takes you to the Body Karate anchor.
