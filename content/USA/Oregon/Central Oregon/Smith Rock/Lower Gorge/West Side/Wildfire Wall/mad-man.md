# Description
The first route put up in the lower gorge, this fun offwidth problem ascends the otherside of the prow that forms Wildfire and is directly below that route's anchors, making it a great TR after you've done its classic neighbor.

# Location
Located about 10' right of Wildfire, its the obvious offwidth.

# Protection
BIG gear- #6's and up.
