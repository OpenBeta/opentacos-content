# Description
Compression type of climb up the column. Climb up the boulders to the right side of the column to the starting ledge. You can clip the first bolt from the ledge, or stick clip the second bolt. Balance left onto the face just below the first bolt. The crux is at the third bolt but one more move above the 4th bolt can be tricky. This route is somewhat contrived but not as contrived as many other popular routes at the Lower Gorge. (eg Child Abuse)

# Location
This route is located just right of "Wildfire" route and left of the off-width "Mad Man". You'll find a prickly bush at the bottom (gooseberry?) but someone may remove it soon.

# Protection
7 glue-in bolts + anchor
