# Description
After looking at the seam above Bad Finger for years I decided to give it a go because Forrest Kaye was going for it on other extensions in the Gorge.  The seam will lead you to a corner.  Once in the corner you can pull some big moves through the roof and mantle the "pool table".

# Location
The route is above Bad Finger, climb up and left until you are stemming on the bad finger and on the road columns.  From hear you follow the seam and corner to the roof.

# Protection
The extension will take two purple Metolius, red c3, and nuts. Anchor and chains at the top.

2 bolts to help inspire people to go climb this thing!
