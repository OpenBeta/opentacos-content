# Description
The crux of this classic climb is the first half of the route.  Insecure feet and thin fingers in the tight starting dihedral lead to a ledge at halfway. From here, a somewhat easier finger crack ends at a steep jumbled headwall.  Rap anchors are just right of this, around a blind corner.

# Location
North end of Wildfire Wall (West side of the Crooked River).

# Protection
Pro to 2 1/2 inches.  Passive pro tricky to place in the first half due to bottlenecks being very narrow and inward crack flaring.  Cams work great in this section.
