# Description
Stem and jam your way up to an obvious flake, then perform some funky stem sequence to get to an easier stembox (crux), follow the crack to the top as it goes from hand to fist.

# Location
The obvious corner between Badfinger and On The Road

# Protection
Watts guide says gear to 3", the top section widens up to 4", though it's short. However it would be useful to have something there to protect a thin traverse to the On The Road anchors. I continued up to the top of the pillar and traversed on good jugs, then downclimbed into the anchor on good hand crack
