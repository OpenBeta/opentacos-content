# Description
This is the farthest upstream route for the Lower Gorge area documented in the Watts guide. It is a must-do for long time gorge aficionados and affords great views around the corner to the Upper Gorge as well as a unique perspective downstream to the Lower Gorge. Climb a short hand crack to a ledge then fire up an easy corner. Thin hands with sharp edges up high lead to a crux pulling through a mini roof with plentiful lichen on the holds to keep things interesting.

# Location
The farthest left side of the Jungleland. Plan to spend 10 minutes or more bushwhacking the 100 yards past Bush Doctor to reach it. You may want to bring a machete.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches. No anchors so bring some tat or down-climb the chimney (5.7 squeeze?) behind and left of the route and scramble down ledges to the ledge beneath the corner system.
