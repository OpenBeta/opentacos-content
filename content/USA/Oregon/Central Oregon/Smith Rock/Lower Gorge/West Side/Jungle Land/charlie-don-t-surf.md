# Description
This route packs a whole lot into one pitch. The crux is a compression boulder problem similar to Child Abuse or The Caning, but two lesser cruxes involve bouldery face climbing on positive crimps. The route starts on the prominent arete  under the first bolt. Prepare to use three aretes, power face climbing,  and a little bit of body position mastery as you fight the pump and solve the sequences. It is easy to top rope Masquerade off of the anchors,  and a worthy link up between the two could easily yield the hardest route in the lower gorge.

# Location
Out in jungle land, right of Masquerade.

# Protection
8 bolts, anchors have fixed steel biners for cleaning
