# Description
This route is the easiest way up the masquerade columns, and combines the lower half of Charlie Don't Surf with the upper half of Masquerade for a diverse and compelling pitch. Column compression, finger locks, and stemming, all separated by a good rest and solid gear, what more could you want?

Jungle book is a great warm up for the other hard pitches here, and leading it allows you to dial the easier climbing on either route, as well as hang a valuable toprope to figure out the perplexing sequences.

# Location
Jungle land, start on CDS and finish on masquerade. At the flake between the 4th and 5th bolts on CDS, move left to the chockstone jug in Masquerade. It is possible to hang a long sling on bolt 5 and unclip it once you're at the jug.

# Protection
4-5 Quickdraws for the first half, doubles from purple to yellow metolius and a standard set of wires for the top. A couple shoulder length runners control the rope drag well at the transition pieces. Fixed steel biners on the anchor.
