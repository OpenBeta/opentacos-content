# Description
A quality straightforward fingercrack more reminiscent of Trout than the Lower Gorge. Lock, reach, stem and lieback, your way up this short but pumpy thin crack.

# Location
About 100 ft left of Masquerade (upriver). Look for an open book with a thin chalked crack running up it. Skirt up the base of the cliff to it about 20 feet before you see it. The next system left of Trout Geek is Lay of the Land 10+ (shares anchor)

# Protection
Fingers to thin. Anchor with fixed biners.
