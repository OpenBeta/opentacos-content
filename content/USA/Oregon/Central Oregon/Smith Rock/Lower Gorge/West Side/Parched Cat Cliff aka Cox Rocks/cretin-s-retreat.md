# Description
It's the obvious corner in the middle of the crag. Stemming and jamming the finger crack gets you most of the way up, with the crux coming at the top when the crack runs out. This route shares a bolted anchor with The Ferret's Dead.

# Location
Parched Cat cliff, this is the first really obvious corner you encounter after scrambling down from the rim.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5 inches
