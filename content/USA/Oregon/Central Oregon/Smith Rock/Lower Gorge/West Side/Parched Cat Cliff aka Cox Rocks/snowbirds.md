# Description
Start on initial corner of Squeal and Peel climbing approximately 30 ft

to a ledge. Step left off of the ledge into a shallow corner marked by an initial hand jam pod. Climb the technical corner passing 3 bolts and two distinct cruxes, after the third bolt move left finishing with the final, exciting crux of Cretins Retreat.

# Location
The shallow dihedral immediately right of Cretin's Retreat

# Protection
Approximately a single set .3-2 BD protects the start and the initial move off the ledge (.75). Three bolts protect the hardest climbing, no more rack is required once you get to the bolts
