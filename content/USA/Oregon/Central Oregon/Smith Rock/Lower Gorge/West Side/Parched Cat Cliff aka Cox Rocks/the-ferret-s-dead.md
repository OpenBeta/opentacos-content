# Description
Start just left of the obvious corner in the center of the crag. Make a few moves to a ledge at the base of a wide crack. Climb this (hexes useful) to a ledge. From there follow a finger and hand crack to a roof. Pass this on the right (fun) to reach the anchors.

This route shares anchors with Cretin's Retreat.
