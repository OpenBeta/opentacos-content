# Description
Climbs the upper headwall directly above Cretin's Retreat, with awesome reaches on good edges and jugs. More exposed than the average LG route! Best linked from the ground via Cretin's or The Ferret's Dead and when done so makes for a four star climb. Rappel or lower from the top with a 70m rope.

# Location
Directly above Cretin's Retreat, the obvious finger crack dihedral.

# Protection
3 bolts and a few small nut and TCU placements. Ring anchors.
