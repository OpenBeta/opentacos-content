# Description
Climb a finger-width crack up a slabby pair of detached columns. Short but fun moves. Good warm up for Wildfire.

# Location
At the far left end of Cox Rocks (Parched Cat Wall). Just left of a 25' boulder leaning against cliff.

# Protection
Gear to 2 inches, mostly finger size. No bolted anchor but there's an easy fifth class downclimb to the left of  the route.
