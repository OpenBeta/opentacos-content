# Description
This route is half sport and half trad.  Half newly bolted terrain joining half of an established line.  Challenging stemming and a classic finger crack make for a fully radical line.  3 new bolts were added on 4/14/15 as well as a new anchor.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
3 bolts and a red Metolius will get you to the finger crack (three finger hack).
