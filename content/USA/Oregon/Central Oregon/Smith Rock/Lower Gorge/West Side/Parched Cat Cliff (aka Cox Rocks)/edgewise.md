# Description
The first route you walk by on your way to all the other classics in the lower gorge is totally worth stopping for. It climbs face holds and an arete high up on perfect chocolate basalt. Standard approach is scrambling uphill around the right side of the crag to a belay bolt. A good alternative is to link from the ground via Little Orphan Jammies (5.10d) fun finger splitter to hard stem corner, using features on the right then straight up to the first bolt.

# Location
Right side of the rimrock headwall.

# Protection
6 bolts. Tips to finger size gear if linking with Little Orphan Jammies. Lower/rap with 70m rope
