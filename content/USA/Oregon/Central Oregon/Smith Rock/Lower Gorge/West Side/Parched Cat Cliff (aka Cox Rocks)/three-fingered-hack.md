# Description
Funky jamming down low opens up into fingerlocks and a barn-door crux sequence.  As of 8/12, there's only one bolt backed up by a small wire for an anchor.  This route is worth doing, but neglected and therefor slightly dirty.

# Location
The obvious leaning fingercrack two lines left of Cretin's Retreat.  Starts on the left side of ledge and traverses left into a new crack at mid-height.

# Protection
Gear to 2".
