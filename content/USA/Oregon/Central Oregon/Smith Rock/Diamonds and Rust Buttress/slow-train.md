# Description
A tricky start leads to fun climbing up a long, sparsely-bolted face.

Enjoyable but quite run-out. Joins Diamonds and Rust at the top.

# Location
Far right side of the buttress, the route starts at the nose of the buttress just below Pleasure Palace.

# Protection
7 bolts, chain anchor. Rap down and left past Schleppin' for Hollywood.
