# Description
Mighty Mouse starts in a V-shaped stem under a cool arete and crack system. Stem your way past the first two bolts before venturing into the face and corner above. Use balance and good footwork to surmount the two small roofs, while using good left hand side pulls and the occasional right corner. The crux stays on you as you exit rightward onto the knobby slabs above. Keep your head about you as you weave over several slabs to the anchors using small nubbins and side pulls. There are probably several ways to climb through the crux, making it a challenge to decipher the best route.

A really fun and varied route on solid stone. Even though it isn’t super long, it contains a lot of different climbing and has an exposed feeling as you climb the corner overlooking the river and Cascades.

Shade all day, perfect for hot summer days or to get away from the crowds.

# Location
This climb is located in the gully just south of the Monkey on the north facing right side uphill from the trail and “Shleppin’ For Hollywood”. Access this route by hiking up the left side of the gully and traversing rightward to the base of the climb once you are level with it. The hillside is mossy and there isn’t a real access path, so tread lightly.

# Protection
7 bolts and chain/carabiner anchors.
