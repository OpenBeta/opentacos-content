# Description
This is a top-roped variation.

Climb the zig-zag hand crack and face that is just left of "Shleppin' for Hollywood". Use the wall on your left briefly before leaving the crack to venture onto the face above using side pulls and crimps. Follow them rightward to join "Shleppin' for Hollywood" at the last bolt. Finish with the crux of "Shleppin".

A nice way to get in some extra fitness and climbing while here, and not a bad line, although still a bit dirty.

# Location
Just left of "Shleppin' for Hollywood" on the north face of Diamonds and Rust buttress.

# Protection
Toprope
