# Description
A true diamond among the rust, the rock on this route is surprisingly solid! Requiring minimal cleaning, the quality should only improve with more traffic. The climbing on this route is notably more physical than the standard Smith crimping. Climb up the right side of the gently overhanging arete using occasional edges on the left face. No one stopper move, but rather a building pump from consistent 5.11 climbing; though between the second and third bolt may require some thought. Shorter folks may find the start to be slightly more difficult.

Thinking it's around 11d/12a, but won't know for sure until more people get on it.

# Location
Look for a trail marked with a small carne on your right if coming down from the Pleasure Palace or on your left if coming up from Mesa Verde. Follow the trail to a perfect natural belay platform.

# Protection
9 Bolts to a 2 Bolt Anchor w/ Rap Rings. Please do not TR or lower off the rap rings! As the name implies, PLEASE RAPPEL ONLY! If toproping, just use a couple quick draws through the rings or build an anchor.
