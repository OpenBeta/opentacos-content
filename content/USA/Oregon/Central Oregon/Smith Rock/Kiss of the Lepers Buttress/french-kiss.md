# Description
P1 - 5.10a crux above the 2nd bolt.

P2 - 5.10a crux above the 5th bolt.

More stout start to First Kiss and if your up for the grade, a good alternative to bypass slow parties on First Kiss. The route is new, so it needs to see some traffic/cleaning, otherwise, a fun climb on good rock.

# Location
French Kiss is roughly 60ft. to the North (climbers left) of First Kiss. This is next to the second tree to the left of First Kiss, with some large huecos, in an obvious water streak.

The first pitch anchors have rap-rings, but you will need a 70 meter rope to rap from here. Otherwise, complete the route to the second pitch anchors with First Kiss and make a double rope rappel, or complete First Kiss.

# Protection
Sport/Bolts

P1 - 9 bolts, P2 - 8 bolts

Ends at the anchors for the 2nd pitch of First Kiss.
