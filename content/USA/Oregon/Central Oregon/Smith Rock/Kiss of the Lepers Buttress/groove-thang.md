# Description
When Allen Watts says secretive, He means it. Looking for this route left me cursing Watts's name but when I found it at the top of a gully it was amazing. The bottom half of the route is stemming in a smoothed tube, similar feature as Hydrotube up at Flagstone. Great protection. The top is a pile. The top becomes the crux not because the moves are difficult but because I am not sure the bots could take a fall. Although the top is foreboding it is a must do route at Smith.

# Location
Kiss of the Leaper Area. Go all the way up the hillside until you come to a gully.  Go up the gully, make a few birthing jokes as you climb up a series of vag shaped holes and then look to your right. You may or may not see the bolts gleaming in the sun light. They are there, trust the good old guide book.  Look for the tube and you will see the bolts.

# Protection
long runner for a couple of the draws. 8 bots. fixed anchors
