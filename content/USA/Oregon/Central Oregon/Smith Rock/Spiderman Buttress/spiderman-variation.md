# Description
This is a really fun climb, done Trad as a single pitch, or as the start to Spiderman.  There's really no crux to speak of (on this single pitch), just sustained, fun, climbing.  Be very careful if lowering off, as a 60 M rope might not quite make it, and downclimbing the last few feet might be required.

# Location
Climb the obvious Open Book immediately to the left of Squashed Spider.  Lower off the chains at the belay station for Spiderman, or finish on Spiderman.  (A 60 meter rope is needed, and even so, be careful when lowering, it's stretched to the limit)

# Protection
Standard Rack
