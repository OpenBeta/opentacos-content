# Description
The route starts to the left of Spiderman.  follow a small dihedral up about 15 feet (you can place a 1.5 friend in the top of the dihedral crack), then up and right past 2 bolts (crux).  gain a thin crack that goes up and back left (5.9) to the belay.

# Location
Spiderman buttress between "in harms way" on the left and "spiderman" on the right.

# Protection
small wires, HB nuts, RP's and tiny cams will get you up the thin crack.  you will need a 1.5 friend for the initial crack in the small dihedral and a couple quickdraws.
