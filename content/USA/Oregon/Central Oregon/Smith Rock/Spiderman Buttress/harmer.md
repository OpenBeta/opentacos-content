# Description
With a sequencing that might make you think twice, and stances that are good enough to think four times, this route require a bit of balance, no endurance, and a close bond between you and your feet.

Beginning on small edges, continue upward into traditional Smith nubbins. Between the second and third bolts, pull off a slabby high step crux to a nearly-no-hands stance, and clip off of a "peanut". Continue two more bolts to the ledge to join the bolted half of In Harms Way for an enjoyable and easy romp to the anchor.

Stays in the shade until about 2pm during early summer.

# Location
Start with shiny glue ins on the large detached block that sports the "Harms Way" ledge, left of the jam/lieback corner of Out of Harms Way.

# Protection
9 bolts to chains
