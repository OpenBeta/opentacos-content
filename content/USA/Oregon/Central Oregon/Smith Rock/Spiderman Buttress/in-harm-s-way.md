# Description
The crux of In Harm's Way is the approximately 30-foot long right-facing dihedral that leads to the ledge that's "Harm's Way".  The dihedral has no bolts but can be easily protected with SLCD's (An alternate start is to climb the first section of Cornerstone to the "Harm's Way" ledge).  Leave the ledge and romp up the fun nubbins and knobs to a nice belay ledge and anchors.  Although there is a second pitch very few climb it.

# Location
In Harm's Way shares the same start with Out of Harm's Way.  Both climbs are just to the right of Explosive Energy Child.

# Protection
Gear to 2 inches for first section then quickdraws to the two bolt anchors.
