# Description
Aside from Cosmos, this route is the best pebble-studded face climb I have done at Smith.  The setting, rock, and lichen are all beautiful and so is the distance from the swarming hordes on the front side of the pass.

Jam and lie-back a small, right-facing dihedral to a comfortable ledge.  Pumpier than it looks.  Clip a bolt, then step out onto the face and tiptoe up endless pebbles to the anchor.  This moderate, somewhat sequential climbing is a treat.

# Location
The first major crack left of Spiderman Variation.

# Protection
Gear to 2", then bolts.
