# Description
This awkward route starts on somewhat easy terrain and moves into a shallow chimney with two hand cracks. the crux is moving out of the chimney and onto the face to the left. Once you have mounted the large block continue moving up onto a run out slab of fairly solid nubbins until you reach anchors at a sizable ledge above with old style bolt anchors with rap rings. the anchor is old but doesn't budge.

# Location
Cornerstone Variation follows the left side of a deep corner Just left of "In Harms Way". Check the guidebook before running up this line or you could end up wrestling with 11+ terrain.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches. A number four C4 protected the crux very well for me. There is a small seam on the upper portion of the slab that I used a number four stopper, but I honestly think it only works for the head game.
