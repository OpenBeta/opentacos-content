# Description
Fragile rock for the first 25 feet leads to a funky but awesome right facing corner crack, out a small roof to the left and then into an easier hand and finger corner crack to the top of the wall. PG 13 rating is for the first 25 feet which is easy climbing (5.6) on not the best rock. Can start in the small gully to the left or you can go straight up the broken face to the corner.

# Location
Located on the far left side of Spiderman Buttress about 200 feet up a sandy rocky eroding slope. The belay position is on a steep sandy slope just before a small gully.

# Protection
Doubles Black Diamond C4s from .4-3 and a #4 may be helpful but not necessary.

Anchor does not have hangers for rappelling. You can walk off, or we left two beaners clipped into the two bolts that could be used. Be careful rappelling as a 60m barely reaches the ground.
