# Description
despite what the guide book says, I would say it's not all that bad if 10a soloing is your jam. Oh, and make sure everyone below is cool with playing "dodge the falling Boulder" before beginning your short jaunt to the chains. It starts with standing on a good sized block and stepping onto nubs. In a few short moves, you'll gain the ramp. At that point, simply walk the left leaning ramp (avoiding the obvious loose blocks) to the chains at the top of said ramp.

# Location
Large block left of the main buttress with a left leaning ramp starting about 15 or so feet off the ground. The anchors are shared by explosive energy child. We climbed this to setup a TR for energy child although there are safer options to do accomplish the same outcome.

# Protection
Gear to 2". I think there was a place for a 3" piece but it looked like chose mud pie. Gear isn't that bad after the starting runout. Anchors with chains at top.
