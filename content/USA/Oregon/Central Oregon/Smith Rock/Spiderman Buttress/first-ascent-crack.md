# Description
A small finger crack to the right of Spiderman.  Great route to practice setting nuts; you can zip it up real tight if you want.  Highly recommended as an intro to placing trad pro.

Two bolts at the top for a great anchor.  Once the TR is set, the slab to the left, between Spiderman, is a fun face to play around on.

# Location
Obvious crack to the right of Spiderman (a classic 2/3 pitch trad route) at the Spiderman buttress just south of Mesa Verde Wall over on the West Side Crags.

Route 48 on page 195 of the 2010 Alan Watts Guide to Smith Rock SP (Smith Rocks Bible)

# Protection
Double set of nuts to 8 should be more than fine; bring your removal tool.  There are a couple pods for throwing in a friend, but not necessary at all.  Two bolts ar the top for an TR anchor.
