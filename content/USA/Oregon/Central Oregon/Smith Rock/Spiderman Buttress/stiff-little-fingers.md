# Description
Short four bolt sport line that is the approach to Captain Fingers. Easy climbing leads to a vertical face with knobs and pockets to a big ledge.

# Location
Far left side of the Spiderman Buttress, about 200 feet up the sandy rocky slope.

# Protection
Quick draws and a #2 or #3 Black Diamond C4 if you want to try and protect between the easy but a bit runout section between the first and second clips.
