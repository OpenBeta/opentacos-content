# Description
Far left side of Spiderman Buttress, about 200 feet up the loose sandy slope. An initial 5.5 R trad line or a much more recommended short 5.9 sport line with 4 bolts (Stiff Little Fingers), lead to a big ledge and the start of Captain Fingers. Captain Fingers starts from the ledge with 25 feet of strenuous finger crack and eases into a finger sized corner crack and then easier low angle cracks to a two bolt anchor with no hangers. We left two beaners to rap off with though. Apparently a walk off is possible as the route used to top out on the ledge above the current anchor.

# Location
Far left side of Spiderman Buttress, about 200 feet up the sandy loose slope. Noticeable jagged finger crack that starts above a big ledge about 50 feet off the ground.

We did a single rappel with a 70 meter rope from the top anchor and made it down easy. A 60 might work for one rap from the top anchor, but definitely tie some knots in the ends of the rope!!

# Protection
Couple of micro cams, then finger sized to hands up top.
