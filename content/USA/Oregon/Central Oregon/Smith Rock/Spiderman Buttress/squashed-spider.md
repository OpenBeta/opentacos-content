# Description
Previously a popular solo route is now a nice bolted route.  Despite tricky moves right off the ground this route would make a great first lead.  The low angled slab requires nubbin pinching and balance but gives several nice rests.

Begin at the bottom of a large fan of rock below spiderman.  Go straight up the face on bolts to the spiderman first pitch anchor.

Rap route (be careful!! a 60m rope barely makes it)

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
12 quickdraws + slings for the anchor
