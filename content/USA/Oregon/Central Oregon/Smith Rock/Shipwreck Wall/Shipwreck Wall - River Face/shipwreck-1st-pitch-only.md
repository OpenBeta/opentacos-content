# Description
The first pitch of Shipwreck can be fun but the upper pitches are to be avoided.  Ascend the shared start of Time To Shower until you reach the crack system that starts in a small book.  Use the crack and work your way up to and through the junky section to the anchors of the first pitch of Time To Power.  Bring your second up or lower to the ground and top-rope the second so they can clean the route.

# Location
Shipwreck is the upward and rightward curving crack between Time To Shower and Time To Power on East Ship River Face.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches.  Two bolt anchor.
