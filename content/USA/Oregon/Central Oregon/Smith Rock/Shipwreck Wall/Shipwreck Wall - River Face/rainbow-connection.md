# Description
Well-protected climbing leads to a perplexing corner culminating in a bulge. Pull up and left on sloping edges, then continue up the decreasing angle until you reach the chains atop a low angle slab.

This is a new route, with some loose rock remaining. The route is cleaning up, but upper portions of the climb require some choice footing. Make sure everyone at the base is wearing a helmet.

# Location
Furthest left route on the river face.
