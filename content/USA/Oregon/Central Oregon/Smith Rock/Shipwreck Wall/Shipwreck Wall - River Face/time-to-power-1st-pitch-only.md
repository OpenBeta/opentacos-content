# Description
The first pitch to Time To Power is only mentioned in Watt's book as something where "you have to plow through an ugly approach pitch to get to the real [5.12c] climbing". Occasional ascents during the last decade on the sparsely placed bolts has improved this pitch to "fun for some" status.

The standard, straight-up start to reach the high on the wall first bolt can be made a bit easier by using a modest ramp system just uphill and to the right of the direct start.  The somewhat tricky crux is protected by the second bolt.

# Location
Just uphill from Time To Shower and Shipwreck.

# Protection
5 bolts on first pitch. Two bolt anchor (could/should be improved if pitch gets more traffic).
