# Description
Time to Power ascends the attractive East Ship face in between the Aggro gully and Ship Wreck gully. A wild & varied route unusual of Smith Rocks. Features everything from difficult slab climbing on flawless red stone to long moves through a pumping overhang. The crux is typical of most 5.12s at smith, near vert, on bad holds.

Other difficulties include waiting for an opportunity to climb the route, as the bottom portion of this route has become quite popular.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
There's a somewhat difficult clip part way up the upper scoop. It's best just to skip it. It's best to approach this route as a single push from the ground. Be aware! A 70 meter rope will barely reach the ground.
