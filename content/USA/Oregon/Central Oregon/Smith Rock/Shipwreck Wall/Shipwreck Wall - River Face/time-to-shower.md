# Description
Ascend a ramp and make the crux move(s) by stepping right around the arete edge to a ramp where a series of bolts leads to the anchors.  The straight-up option is substantially more difficult and not recommended but, due to the location of the protection, doable.

# Location
A few feet downhill and to the left of the starts to Time to Power and Shipwreck.

# Protection
5 Bolts. Two bolt anchor.
