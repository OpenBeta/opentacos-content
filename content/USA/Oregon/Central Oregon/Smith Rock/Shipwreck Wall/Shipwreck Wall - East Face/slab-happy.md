# Description
This is a somewhat chossy route (update: no longer chossy!), but if you want to warm up for the 10's and 11's, this is a decent option.  Start from the left, and watch for moss, the first bolt is high.

Expect to stand on your feet for most of it, with only a few moves where you have to pull.

# Location
In the middle of the Table Scraps Wall, about thirty feet left of side-by-side crack and water groove.

I've included this route on the Shipwreck wall because the Table Scraps wall, as an area, would only have one good route in it (Fish n Chips).  Also, while Table Scraps is a separate face, it's hardly a separate area, they are a thirty second scramble from one another.

If you are trying to locate Table Scraps Wall, hike a steep, long uphill past Lower Shipwreck and Upper Shipwreck until you see a low angle slab on the right with decent rock.

# Protection
Bolts, 7 or so
