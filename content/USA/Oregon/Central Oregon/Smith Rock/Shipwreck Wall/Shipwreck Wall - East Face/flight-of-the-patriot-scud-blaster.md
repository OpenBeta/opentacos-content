# Description
This short route has one committing hard sequence just after the second bolt, launching into tricky bulge moves from an undercling.  After this, a much easier challenge gets you to the anchors.  I've heard some climbers hate this route (and would probably give it a bomb).  For myself, I think a one star minus or 1/2 star is fitting as I liked the challenge of the one hard sequence.

# Location
Starts upslope from the second platform/landing on the trail up Shipwreck, just above the start for

Purple Aces

.

# Protection
Bolts (aprox. 4) and Rap Anchors.
