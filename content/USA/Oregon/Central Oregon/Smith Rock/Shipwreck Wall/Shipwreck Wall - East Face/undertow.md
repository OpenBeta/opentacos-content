# Description
While obviously not as classic as Tsunami, this variation is a great option if your looking for a slightly easier tick.

Begin on Riptide, clipping the first three bolts.  Traverse hard left into the final roof of Tsunami.  The traverse is not trivial and requires an attentive belay.  This part is fairly reachy and will probably require some crappy intermediates if you don't have the wingspan. Finish on Tsunami; this is the section that makes the climb 5.12.

# Location
