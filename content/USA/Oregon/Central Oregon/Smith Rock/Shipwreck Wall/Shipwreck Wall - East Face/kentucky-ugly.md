# Description
Sitting right next to the classic Bolt From the Blue, this neglected line deserves more traffic. Possible crux at the third bolt clearing a bulge, then veer left to avoid the worst rock in the easy middle section. The upper wall offers fun pulls between good pockets and jugs, culminating with a pumpy crux at the top. Moving up to the anchors on small knobs adds just a bit of spice. Lower off with a 70m.

# Location
Immediately right of Bolt from the Blue

# Protection
11 bolts + anchors.
