A near continuously challenging route from beginning to end.  The crux hits at the 3rd bolt with bulge moves using two odd hueco-like features with cracks inset in them.  Finish with another hard (11-) move near the top.

# Location
Starts up past the second "landing"/platform going up the Shipwreck trail.

# Protection
Bolts (aprox. 6) and Rap Anchors.
