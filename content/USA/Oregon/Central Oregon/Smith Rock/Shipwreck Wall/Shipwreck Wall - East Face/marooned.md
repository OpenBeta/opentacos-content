# Description
Quality challenging climbing in the first 30 feet of this route lead to an easy finish on poorer quality rock.  Start in the left side of a large dish  and move up and right with thin balancy moves leading to a couple larger holds.  The crux is moving through these holds and exiting left over the bulge.  From here, the climbing progressively gets easier as the rock deteriorates.

# Location
