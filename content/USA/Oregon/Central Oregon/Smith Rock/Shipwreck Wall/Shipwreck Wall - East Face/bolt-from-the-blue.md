# Description
Climb a tricky bulge at the start (11-) to easy ground and an anchor.  Continue on fun jugs for a few bolts until the holds shrink for the obvious crux section.  Keep your cool and fight the pump to the upper anchor. Lower with a 70m rope or lower to the first anchor with a 60m and re-thread.

# Location
The obvious black streak high on the Shipwreck Wall.

# Protection
bolts
