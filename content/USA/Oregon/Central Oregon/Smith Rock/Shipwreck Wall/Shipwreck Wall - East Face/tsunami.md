# Description
One of the most aesthetic lines at smith. The only fitting description is, MEGA! Starts in a somewhat awkward corner before clearing the first roof on good holds. Rest up before the second roof and the technical crux, sequential pockety crimps to a decent rest below the third roof. Traverse using either face holds or underclinging the roof, whichever feels better to you and prepare yourself for the redpoint crux, the massive pump generated while cranking good holds to the chains.

# Location
Far above the river near the top of the Shipwreck gully. It is impossible to miss the impossing triple roofs of this route.

# Protection
13 bolts, usually sports fixed gear. Long slings mandatory on a few bolts.
