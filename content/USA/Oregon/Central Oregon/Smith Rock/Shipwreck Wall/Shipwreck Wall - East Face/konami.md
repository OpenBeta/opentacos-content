# Description
This route follows the obvious natural feature that can be seen from the parking lot (left trending roof system). It starts with easy slab for three bolts then climbs a short steep part to position under the roof system. The forth bolt is located up high near the roof due to the quality of rock. Use a long sling on this one. Undercling, lieback, head/shoulder scum, or whatever it takes to traverse left under the blocky roof (two more bolts, probably the crux). Turn over up into the left facing corner to clip the 7th bolt. Keep traversing to the left under the small roof on the face to clip the last bolt. Move left to the right facing crack system, which leads to the anchor.

*A very short quickdraw on the 6th bolt will keep your rope from rubbing the roof edge.

# Location
This route is located just to the left of Bolt from the Blue, on Shipwreck Wall-Upper Face. It starts from the same terrace as Bolt from the Blue.

# Protection
8 Glue-in bolts + Anchor
