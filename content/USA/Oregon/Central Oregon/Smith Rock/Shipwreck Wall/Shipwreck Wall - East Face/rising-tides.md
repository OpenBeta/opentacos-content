# Description
A unique experience. After tiptoeing past the bottom 20ft of "shattered rubble"(stick clip highly recomended as I think you could spend all day pulling 10 lb to 50 lb chunks out of the start), the rock turns solid as you enter a long section of liebacking. At the end of the lieback make a long reach to another crack system, this is potentially the hardest move on a redpoint burn. The technical crux comes higher, after a complete rest on the flake move up and right to good huecos just below the roof, clip the last bolt and find a good pocket out left and finish it out.

# Location
High in the Shipwreck Gully, Directly left of Tsunami

# Protection
8 bolts, stick clip.
