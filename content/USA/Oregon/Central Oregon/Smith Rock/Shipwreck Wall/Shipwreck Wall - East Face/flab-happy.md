# Description
This line can only be TR'd. It's right next to Slab Happy,  worth doing if you have hiked up the gully and led Slab Happy already. Start is easy climbing with big holds I think I did a mantle here. Middle section is the 11- part as the angle goes vertical (or very slightly past) and the holds dry up. Pull through some nubs and edges with poor feet. Some crumbly holds made me glad to be on TR. The top is easier climbing on fun jugs and pockets, slightly steeper than Slab Happy.

# Location
On table Scraps wall to the left of the crack. Two bolt anchor accessed from Slab Happy. In Watt's guidebook it looks like the route goes straight up to the anchor. I did go somewhat towards the right through the crux, however.

# Protection
Set a toprope from two bolts up and to the right of the Slab Happy anchors. One other bolt approx. 2/3rds of the way up,
