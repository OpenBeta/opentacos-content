An incredibly fun route toward the top of the Southeast Face, this climb works through a fun traversing section down low and then reaches amazing jugs and tufa-like features which bring you to the crux moves on some thinner crimps before finishing on jugs.  Super fun and worthwhile.

# Location
Up the hill on the Southeast Face.  Just right of King of Pain.

# Protection
9 bolts
