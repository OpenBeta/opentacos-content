# Description
Start up the face/seam just left of the arete clipping older looking glue-ins for the first 4 clips. Veer a bit right through some odd polished rock and follow a dike for a bit before gaining the arete.

Once you reach the arete you will be clipping new bolts.

Follow the arete to a Fixe biner anchor.

# Location
The East face of Koala has a few newer bolted lines. This route is the arete about 200 yards uphill from the

Thin Air

area just before the rock becomes very overhanging.
