Short route has a stout crux with hidden crimps on the right side. commitment is a must to get through it clean if you don't climb much harder than the grade with gear. the route eases after the bulge.

# Location
Flairing crack on the upper side of Koala. the only flairing finger crack.

# Protection
Pro to 2.5" expect gear to be a little wierd at first. Anchors, chains.
