# Description
A short route on a great rock. Stick clipping the first bolt recommended. This route had been chopped and ignored for a long time till the recent re-establishment. Nobody seem to know exactly who chopped it. Definitely not by the first ascentionist. According to Alan Watts, well over a decade ago there was this guy who went around the park and chopped routes for his own whatever the reasoning, and it could've been chopped by the same guy. Anyway all the original holes were in great shape and it's been re-bolted with the modern glue-ins.

# Location
on the north face of Koala Rock

# Protection
3 Glue-in bolts and anchor
