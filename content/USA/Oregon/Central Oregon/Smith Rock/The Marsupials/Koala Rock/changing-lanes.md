# Description
A fun way to plug some cams after lugging the rack up for Thin Air. A little contrived but good climbing nonetheless. Start up the thin crack of Thin Air's first pitch (5.9+ if the cheater block is not used), then traverse/ undercling the obvious horizontal crack out right, then follow the crack straight up to anchors for Suck My Kiss. You can clip the last bolt of that route or head up straight up to the anchors from your last piece of pro on easy terrain.

Can also be used as a slightly more engaging first pitch for Thin Air.

# Location
Same start as Thin Air.

# Protection
Stoppers; cams from .3 to 2.
