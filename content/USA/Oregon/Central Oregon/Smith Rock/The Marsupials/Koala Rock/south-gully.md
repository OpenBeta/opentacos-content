# Description
Easy route to Thin Air's anchors if you have gear or if Koala Rock is busy(!) Many options for protection until easy last few feet to anchors. Some of the placements are fiddly though. Loose rock up high, and somewhat grittyâ€”what you would expect from an obscure 5.4 trad route.

# Location
Follow the right-most crack in the "gully"

# Protection
Cams to 3". I placed a couple offset cams and you could probably use nuts, too.
