# Description
This route has Smith Rock's biggest Knob. The thing is huge! The crux hits early at the first bolt, try to grab, hold, and move off the knob. As soon as you reach the second bolt, the holds turn huge, and the climbing turns much easier.

# Location
It is located on the back (uphill side) of Koala Rock. The best hiking approach is on the right side, past Ryans Arete, etc. You can also climb any of the routes to the top, and rap off the back, and you will be right there. It is the furthest right route on the wall.

# Protection
Bolts, Anchor
