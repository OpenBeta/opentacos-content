# Description
The crux comes after the 5th bolt, trying to get to a right hand crimp that seems so far away. A high left foot is crucial here. From there, wonderful positive crimps lead to a shared anchor with Cool Air. This route has some of the best stone in the park!

# Location
Starts just to the right of Cool Air and to the left of Ryans Arete. Step onto the wall from the top of the chimney/ledge to avoid the 10 foot scramble on the loose chimney.

# Protection
9 bolts
