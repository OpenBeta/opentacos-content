# Description
The crux would probably be pulling away from the crack and moving to the right toward the anchors. The crack is pretty self explanitory with mostly stemming and palming/edges. The gear is so-so.

# Location
The first crack to the left of the 3rd class walk-off. two short bolt lines are directly to the right.

# Protection
Pro to 3". Anchors are same as Hero. rap.
