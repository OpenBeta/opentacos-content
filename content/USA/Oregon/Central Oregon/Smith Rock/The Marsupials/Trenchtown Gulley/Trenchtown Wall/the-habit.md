# Description
Alex Reed's first legit route he put up. Besides a 5.7 route called "Munchies", this was Alex's first proud developed route. Boulder your way up a bulge to get established in an eye catching dihedral. Funk your way through the dihedral only to find yourself at the real heartbreaker crux going for the chains. A tough one to send.

# Location
Start in the center of the wall on the 2nd most left route

# Protection
12 bolts and fixed anchors with steel carabiners
