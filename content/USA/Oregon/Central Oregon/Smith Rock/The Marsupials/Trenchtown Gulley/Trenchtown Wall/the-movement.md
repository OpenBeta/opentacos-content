# Description
Still in need of a little traffic at the start. Start out on steep 5.11+ climbing for the first 3 or 4 bolts. Work your way up to a baffling arete crux and link into the same end of the habit.

# Location
Just to the right of The Habit. Share the end.

# Protection
13 bolts and steel fixed chains
