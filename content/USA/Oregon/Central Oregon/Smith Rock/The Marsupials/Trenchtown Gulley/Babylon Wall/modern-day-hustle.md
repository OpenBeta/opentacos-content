# Description
Begin up a bouldery rounded arete onto a couple hold-less slab moves. This may be the crux for many. Then traverse up and right to the base of the overhang where theres an obvious rail under a giant pocket. Use your imagination for this move! Clip the last bolt and get ready to climb well above your last bolt for the chains.

# Location
Starts on red draws to the right of the dihedral in the center of the wall. Follows up the red draws all the way to the chains.

# Protection
Fixed draws with  fixed steel carabiners at the anchors
