# Description
Begin up a slab that never feels insecure to move on. Awkwardly facing holds lead to a stopper crux as the wall goes vert. While it seems there could be multiple options for this crux, a very small hold seems to be entirely unavoidable to crank on. After the 5th bolt, the climbing eases but the final runout for the chains makes for a gripping experience.

# Location
3rd route to the right of System of a Down (the arete) Follows up yellow fixed draws.

# Protection
All fixed yellow steel draws with steel carabiners at the chains.
