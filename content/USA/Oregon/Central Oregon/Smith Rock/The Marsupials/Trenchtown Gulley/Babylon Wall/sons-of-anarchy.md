# Description
Start up the big offsets on a seam with multiple 5.11+ cruxes till the wall steepens at the last 2 bolts. Going for the last bolt, the climbing begins to get harder until a baffling crux passing the last bolt. Then the pucker factor goes up as the holds disappear well above your protection. There is a clipping stance somewhere up there!!

# Location
2nd route to the right of System of a Down (the arete)

# Protection
All fixed red draws. Fixed steel carabiners at the anchors as well.
