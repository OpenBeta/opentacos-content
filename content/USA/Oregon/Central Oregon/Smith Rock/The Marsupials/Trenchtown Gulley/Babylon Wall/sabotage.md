# Description
Starts with a boulder problem passing the 1st bolt then to a no hands at the 2nd. Climb up thru the roof to the crux moves onto the face. Climbing lets up more and more after the 5th and 6th. A good pump combined with some route finding should keep the run to the anchor engaging.

# Location
Fixed yellow draws on the right side of the wall. First bolt is hard to clip.

# Protection
Fixed yellow draws with steel carabiners at the anchors
