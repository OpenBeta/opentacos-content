# Description
The System rides straight up the eye catching arete on the left side of the wall. It is the longest, hardest, and most classic line on the wall. Start up a perplexing 5.10 slab to the base of the holdless arete. Get the first 2 bolt clipped on the arete (a challenge in its own) and begin up the blunt arete for 6 bolts of brutal power endurance.

# Location
Most left route on the Babylon walls steep right side. Goes straight up the overhanging arete off the slab below.

# Protection
All fixed with Steel draws
