# Description
Begin on the boulder start of Modern Day Hustle on Red fixed draws. After the 2nd draw, begin up the left variation as the draws change color. The climbing difficulty increases dramatically as you get further up the overhang. Intense pockets and small hard-to-find crimps lead through the crux at the last 2 bolts.

# Location
Start off Modern Day Hustle on the first two red Red draws, then branch out left on Powerslave fixed with yellow draws.

# Protection
All fixed lead draws and steel carabiners at the anchors
