# Description
A solid seam that gradually steepens before a powerful heartbreaking crux with limited holds Â passing the last bolt. Getting to the last bolt is around 12+ finished with a cryptic 13- crux going for the chains. A good endurance route with great movement.

# Location
1st route to the right of System of a Down (the arete). Fully equipped with blue steel draws.

# Protection
All fixed with steel draws and steel carabiners at the anchor.
