# Description
Start the climb next to a big dihedral until it ends at an overhang at the 3rd bolt. This is where the difficulty gradually increases until you reach the extremely powerful crux passing the 5th bolt. It doesn't seem to ease off until the chains are clipped.

# Location
starts in a obvious dihedral in the center of the wall. Fixed with all blue steel draws.

# Protection
Fixed with blue steel draws! Fixed steel carabiners at the anchors as well
