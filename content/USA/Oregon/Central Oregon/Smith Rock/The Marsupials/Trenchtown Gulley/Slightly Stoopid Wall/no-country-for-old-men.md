# Description
This crumble-fest reminds me of what the aggro gulley must have been like before its popularity. For many, the quality of movement and challenge of the route will justify its crumbles for now. (After some traffic, it will no longer be an issue)

Start off a small ledge and immediately start cranking on awkward holds that get better with good body positing. Clipping the 2nd bolts and passing it is the crux, although the uppercut has lots of little cruxes. Clear a small overhang to get to the anchors.

# Location
Starts on a terrace 5ft below the scooped out cave.

# Protection
bolted with fixed draws all the way to the chains
