# Description
This route starts on a steep slab next to the arete and then steps around the arete onto the side of the dome. The crux comes at the third bolt with a few balance steps and smears. Good climb but is awkward to setup for a top rope.

# Location
Starts in the pass between Mini Half Dome and Brogan spire. Look for bolts running up the south side of the wall and around the arete.

# Protection
Bolts. Anchors are on the north end just over the actual summit.
