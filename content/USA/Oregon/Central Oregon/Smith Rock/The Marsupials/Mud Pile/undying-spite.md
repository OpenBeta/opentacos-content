# Description
Begin by establishing yourself on large (not deep) pockets and work your way up through the first few bolts on small edges and knobs with plenty of solid feet. You'll soon find yourself at the crux of the route: a bouldery sequence over a bulge using a diagonal finger crack. Clip the bolt from a solid, but slightly painful, finger lock and power through the next couple of moves. You'll be rewarded with a nice rest, followed by some enjoyable climbing around the arete to the first set of anchors.

You can lower here here or continue to the top of the Mud Pile with 5 additional bolts of pleasant 5.8 slab.

# Location
Sits far to the right of "Kid-Packed Mini-Van From Hell" and just to the left of "Lusty Lady." The first bolt of the route is just to the right of a dark, rightward-pointing, somewhat licheny flake.

# Protection
8 glue-ins to the first set of anchors; 14 to the second set. No drop-ins, so bring extra draws. Rap or lower through the hardware, but don't TR through any fixed gear.
