# Description
This route is more sustained and painful than its 11b neighbor.  Some of the difficulty arises around the second bolt where you must grab shallow sharp pockets and do your best to find big hidden foot holds (a small bulge blocks your view).

Near the top you must make some strenuous moves to a large "handle."  Wrap your whole arm around the feature for the clip then progress rightward to the anchors.

# Location
To the right of Rampage on the southern tip of the mudpile

# Protection
Bolts and fixed biners at the anchors
