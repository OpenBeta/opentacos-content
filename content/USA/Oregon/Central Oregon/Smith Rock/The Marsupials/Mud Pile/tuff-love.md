# Description
Tuff Love shares the first two bolts with Tuff Shit. Â After the second bolt, trend left and follow the bolt line in the center of the wall. After climbing the easy slab, arrive at a good jug clipping hold. Clip from a good stance and work your way into the crux of the route. Maneuver over the water groove running through the roof. Clear the lip of the roof and enjoy the last 2 bolts of easy climbing to the anchors on the slab above.

# Location
Tuff Love shares start with Tuff Shit.

# Protection
8 bolts with 2 anchor bolts.
