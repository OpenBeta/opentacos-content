# Description
A fun adventurous route with some lightly overhung sections at the bottom and lots of jugs. You can reach the first bolt from starting standing on the boulder. There are a lot of cool hueco features on this, make sure to find the kneebar rest! Bring some longer draws or alpines for the top section, there are some ledges that will make the rope zigzaggy. Once at the anchor, it's an easy fifth scramble up the crack feature maybe 15' to the top of the Mud Pile, highly recommended to go up there and scope the view of all of the Marsupials and Smith Rock in the distance!

A 60 meter rope will be too short! FA did this route with a 64m and there was about 10' left at the end. All loose blocks and dangerous choss have been cleaned up, but as with all new routes at Smith, there's a lot of surface crumbles and the more traffic this gets the better it will clean up.

# Location
On the east face of the Mud Pile facing the Kangaroo, just uphill of the big cave.

# Protection
12 bolts (maybe 13?)
