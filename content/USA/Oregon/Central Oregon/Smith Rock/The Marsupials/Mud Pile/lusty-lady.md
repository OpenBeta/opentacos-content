# Description
Start up the climb "Carla the Stripper" and at the midpoint anchors veer up and left following the bolt line ascending the nice slab just left of Carla. Bring some long runners to reduce rope-drag. Belay your second up from the top of the crag. This route can also be lead as two pitches but makes a really nice long single pitch...

# Location
West face of The Mudpile. Start on the left side of a large flake leaning against the base of the wall.

# Protection
14 Bolts, Alpine draws to reduce rope-drag
