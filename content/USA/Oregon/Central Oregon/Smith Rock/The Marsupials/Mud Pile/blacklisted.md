# Description
Route starts on some fun dishes and knobs. The fun starts at the mini-arete jutting off the face to a fun reachy couple of moves over the bulge. Run out of easy scrambling to the mid-point anchors makes for a fun bottom half.

# Location
Take the Burma Road to the base of the Koala rock. Instead of going up the scree path to Koala Rock, take the lower trail at the apex of the switchback and traverse the easy going contrived trail to the Mud Pile just to the right of Brogan's Spire. The easiest way to get the start is to hike down the hill until the crag turns to face the west. The route is shortly after you pass the Delerium Tremens block.On the West Face of Mudpile. Route to the right of Lusty Lady(Starting pitch of Carla the Stripper). Belay spot starts on a ledge.

# Protection
14 bolts for the complete route. Mid-point anchors after 8 bolts(only part of the pitch worth doing if you are looking for a 5.10b route, the rest is a scramble to the top). Rap down off of the mid-point anchors.
