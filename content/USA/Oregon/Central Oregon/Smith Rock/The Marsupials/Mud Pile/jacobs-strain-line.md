# Description
Super steep huge pockets lead through a few bolts to the horizontal offset feature. The crux comes in the middle of the route, a powerful crossover leads to a dynamic move to a HUGE jug. All the while cranking on blatantly epoxyed holds. Pieces of rock were glued on to create the crux holds. The amount of epoxy might make you nauseous. If you can ignore the ethical dilemma you will surely enjoy the athletic movement of this amazingly steep route. Juggy climbing protects the anchors. Definitely 3 stars if not for some loose rock up higher and the previously mentioned gluefest.

# Location
Steep rock junkies won't miss the massive cave on the river side of the mudpile. Two routes left of Rampage. The start is just right of the large boulder.

# Protection
9 bolts to hangers. Some fixed draws as of Spring 2011 although they are a bit sun bleached.
