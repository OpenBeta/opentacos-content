# Description
This route is a good choice if you want to climb on some really wild overhanging features.  At one point on the route you have the choice of grabbing a crimp, a tufa, or a pile of poo.

Crank a hard start off the ground.  Then traverse 20 feet on spooky crusty holds.  A bouldery crux awaits you at the anchors.  Some trickery, such as a kneebar may help you through this section.

# Location
This route is at the southern tip of the mudpile.  It will be the first route to the right of the severely overhanging "cave" routes.

# Protection
Bolts and fixed biners on the anchors
