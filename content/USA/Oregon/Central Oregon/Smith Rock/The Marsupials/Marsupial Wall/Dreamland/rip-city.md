# Description
Rip City starts in a crack which leads to a face followed by a intimidating overhanging arete that seems to have no holds. Once the beta is unlocked, the move becomes manageable. Until then it seems pretty bare! No matter what you figure, pulling hard is mandatory.

# Location
Right of bucket list. 3rd highest route on the left side of the marsupial wall. Starts in a crack and leads to an obvious overhanging arete.

# Protection
Fixed all the way
