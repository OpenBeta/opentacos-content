# Description
Another unique climb on the wall! Might be the most sustained climbing on the wall with hard bouldery cruxes in the mix. Looking up on the climb is like vertical whoops for a bike. Changing angles of steepness keep this climb different from others.

Start out canvasing on small crimps on steep terrain before the larger feature starts to appear. Get ready for a battle after leaving an awkward jug passing the third bolt. Going past the 2nd to last bolt can be a bit heady, and going to the chains.

# Location
Above Lords of Dogtown. Start climbing tip toeing off the massive terrace.

# Protection
Fixed lead and anchor steel carabiners.
