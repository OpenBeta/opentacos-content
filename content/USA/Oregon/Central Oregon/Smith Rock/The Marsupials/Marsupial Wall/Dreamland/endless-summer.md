# Description
If you really want to take advantage of the entire wall, Endless Summer is the perfect route for you. Start out on the cruxy 5.11 bit on Off the Wall and traverse all the way to the bucket list 5th bolt, then traverse into Lords of Dogtown just in time for all of the hard climbing! 13 bolts of fun. Back clean what you can and use slings to keep the rope running straight.

(I only had 3 bolts clipped by the time I got on Lords of Dogtown from back cleaning. Rope-drag wasn't bad. Ive also done it with every bolt clipped as well and still had no drag issues)

# Location
All over the Dreamland Wall

# Protection
13 bolts. Most of the traverse is fixed, although runners on a few bolts will help with rope drag.
