# Description
Start out in a small overhang off the second terrace. A hard boulder crux on slopping holds with big throws starts the route, leading to the 3rd bolt. Traverse out left onto Rip City and clip the two long slings and find a way to the horn. Don't be shy to use holds on Rip City, these two lines share holds. Then climb the steep overhang only to get to a hard redpoint crux to gain access to the vert wall. Don't lose your head!

# Location
Middle route on the overhang.

# Protection
Fixed with steel draws
