# Description
Off the Wall features a compact crux followed by big overhanging moves on jugs. Start out on a jug left of the bolt line and climb through small crimps to get to the second bolt. True crux is after clipping the third bolt throwing to a jug, committing to the off the wall move. After the first anchor, continue up 2 more bolts following a seam to finish an even longer route. It doesn't add to the grade but it does add more fun 5.11 climbing.

If it is your first time out to the Marsupial Wall and you can climb 5.12, this is the line to make sure you get on. While the beginning is typical climbing for Smith Rocks, the overhang features jugs and big moves that will justify the long slog out. Closely placed bolts also make this a good lead for aspiring 5.12 climbers. Could be 5.11c or 5.11d.

# Location
Left Side of the Marsupial Wall, 2nd most left route as of now.
