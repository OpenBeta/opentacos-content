# Description
This unbelievable feature offers great crack and dihedral climbing capped by a pumpy overhang on big features. Climb through the first 4 bolts stemming in a 3 sided dihedral and then pull a 3 foot roof onto another dihedral (the crux). Finish on 5.11+ moves on pumpy big features for the last 3 bolts. Going to the anchors is quite exciting while trying to deal with the pump. A top rope can easily be set up off the bucket list.

If Lords of Dogtown isn't enough climbing, start on Off the Wall and traverse across 4 routes on a crack system. Traverse off the bucket list at the 5th bolt. This is called Endless Summer. It might up the grade to 12d.

# Location
Left of bucket list and off the same anchors.

# Protection
8 bolts total. Last 3 are currently fixed and soon the whole route will be. For now, extend the 4th bolt with a sling to avoid rope drag. Slinging the 1st and 2nd will reduce significant rope drag as well do to the 3 dimensional nature of the climb.
