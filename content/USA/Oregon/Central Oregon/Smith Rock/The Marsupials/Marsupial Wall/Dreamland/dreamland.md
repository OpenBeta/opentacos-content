# Description
Start next to Off the Wall and work your way up a vertical rail just right of the bolts. Getting to the third bolt is a good technical warmup for what is to come. Above the 3rd bolt is a perplexing crux that requires some good imagination to make unbelievably bad handholds work. The overhanging headwall is probably around 12- and builds a great pump.

(Stay true to the line, don’t climb the neighboring off the wall at the cruxes for the full affect.)

# Location
2nd most left route. Right of Off the Wall
