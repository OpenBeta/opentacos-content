# Description
Traverse in off a terrace on jugs to the first bolt. Do some cranking on crimps passing the initial bulge. Clearing the next bulge is easier but still tenuous. Still needs some traffic to get some crumbs off, but overall a good bouldery route for the grade.

Shares finish with Daily Grind (5.10a)

# Location
Starts uphill (left) from Transworld (5.13a), the most uphill route with fixed draws. Starts off mid way ups a terrace. Be careful not to break down the terrace as you start.

# Protection
just quickdraw. Fixed steel at the anchors.
