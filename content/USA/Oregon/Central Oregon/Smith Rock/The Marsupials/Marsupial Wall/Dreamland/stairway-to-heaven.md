# Description
At the top of the gulley lies an inmistakable overhanging prowl hanging over a slab. Scramble up a ledge to reach the belay and clip the belay bolt until the first high bolt is clipped. Starts of on an exciting 5.9 slab to get to the overhanging jug haul! Four bolts of wrapper jugs and big moves, unlike most climbs at smith. Might be pumpier than toxic but is less technical making it a fun onsight.  If you make it up to the marsupial wall, this climb should be on the To-Do list.

# Location
At the top of the gulley on the left side of the Marsupial Wall. Follow the rock stairway (soon to be complete) until it ends and scurry up the scree the reach the base of the route. Then climb atop a 7ft ledge to reach the belay bolt

# Protection
Quickdraws. Long ones at the roof are nice but not at all necessary. 10 draws plus the anchor. Leave the extra QuickDraw on the anchor please.
