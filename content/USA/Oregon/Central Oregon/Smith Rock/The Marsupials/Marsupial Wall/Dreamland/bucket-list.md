# Description
Finally another climb like Toxic! Huge jugs up a steep angle make up 100% of the climb! A great warm up for strong climbers and a good climb to project for aspiring 5.11 climbers. Fun and pumpy with aÂ cryptic crux passing the 2nd bolt.

This climb is no longer R rated. Safe the whole way, ENJOY! Also the 5th bolt got move and replaced
