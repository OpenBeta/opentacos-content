# Description
Start off the lowest point of the right side of the cave. Theres no feet for the first 5 feet due to the deep steep cave. Muster your way onto the face only to reach a harder crux at the 4th bolt. After the 5th bolt, the climbing doesn't ease up much and has lots of beta intensive movement. By the time the holds get bigger, you are pumped and on steep terrain.

# Location
Only start out of the cave on the Maiden Oregon Wall. Second most right route as of Â July 2018.

# Protection
6 draws, everything else is fixed
