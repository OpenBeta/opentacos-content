# Description
A four start route besides a ramp start and an awkward start onto the hard face climbing. Exiting the ramp onto the face is best describes as a process, it takes time to find a valid sequence. You dont have to exit the ramp until you are absolutely forced. Once on the face, the climbing stays on very high quality stone all the way to the top. Hard crimpy reaches lead all the way up to a roof with both good and bad holds. The second to last bolt tough to clip.

# Location
Start off an easy ramp pitch and start clipping bolts on the face after the first bolt. most left route on the salmon colored rock face. Start in a weird chimney crack.

# Protection
2 slings and 7 bolts. Anchors have fixed steel carabiners
