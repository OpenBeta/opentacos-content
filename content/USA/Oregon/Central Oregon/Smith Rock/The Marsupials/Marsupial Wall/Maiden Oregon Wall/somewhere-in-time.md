# Description
Do some leisure slab moves to the first bolt before a seamlessly endless crux. Small crimps and oddly placed feet lead to a v7 crux pulling out of a mini alcove where the seam opens up. Instead of going left into 5.11 climbing, continue out right into the pumpy top of Wasted Year for a good test of pump management. (A long sling on the 7th bolt of Number of the Beast and the link up bolt will help with rope drag. I needed all the help I could get.)

# Location
Traverse out right off the highest terrace of the Maiden Oregon Wall to a low first bolt. Continue up for 7 bolts and traverse out right for the top of Wasted Years.

# Protection
All fixed draws except the first 2
