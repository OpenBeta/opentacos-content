# Description
Start out on a ramp that quickly steepens only to find a long series of half pad crimps. At the 5th bolt, tackle the actual crux as the pump settles in. After the crux, a heady bolt spacing guards the good rest and the 5.12 finish.

# Location
Starts just right of the crack that splits the left side of the wall.

# Protection
Every draw is fixed but the bottom 4
