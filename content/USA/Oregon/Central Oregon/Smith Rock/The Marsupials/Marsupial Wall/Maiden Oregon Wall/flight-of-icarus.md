# Description
Start as for Run to the Hills and move left at the second bolt. The well protected crux comes early on with technical moves though a bulge. Â The second half of the route is easier, with imperfect rock and a thought-provoking finish going to the anchor.

# Location
Far right side of Maiden Oregon wall, before dropping down to the Colosseum

# Protection
10 bolts
