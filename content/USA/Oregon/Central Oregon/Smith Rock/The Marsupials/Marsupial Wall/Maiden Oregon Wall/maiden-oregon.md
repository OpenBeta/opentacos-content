# Description
One of the most varied 5.12a's in the park. Start off on a bouldery start with big holds. After the 5th bolt, climbing stays consistantly hard all the way to the top. Big irregular hand holds are hard to hold onto as the steepnes begins to fatigue your arms. Finish off on a steep section that clears onto a slab, where the anchors are located.

(either have a very attentive belay passing the first bolt, or stick clip the second)

# Location
Start at the end of the right side of the cave.

# Protection
9 bolts, one is fixed
