# Description
Probably the highest quality and most varied route on the Maiden Oregon Wall. Climb onto a slab above the cave and clip the first bolt from a no hands stance. Then the climbing quickly turns on and is quiet bouldery for the first 5 bolts. Get one last good no hands and head into the hard 5.13 mono crux before the traverse and the heart-braking redpoint curx above the last bolt. Don't be shy to skip the last bolt, its a run but its a damn hard clip.

# Location
Most left route above the cave. Start out on the left side of the cave and traverse in off the first terrace.Stay left at the y of bolt lines. The right line goes into Crowd Pleaser

# Protection
Entirely Fixed. Bring a nice rope
