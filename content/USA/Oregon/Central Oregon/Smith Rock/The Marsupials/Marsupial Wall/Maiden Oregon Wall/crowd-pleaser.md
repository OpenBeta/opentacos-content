# Description
Share the start with Wasted Years and cut off right after the 4th bolt. The first 5 bolts riddles down after a couple laps, but the first time up can be perplexing. After you get the 5th bolt clipped, start into the meat of the 5.12 climbing as it continually gets harder and builds a solid pump.

# Location
Most left route above the cave. Start out on the left side of the cave and traverse in off the first terrace. Stay right at the y of bolt lines. The left line goes into Wasted Years

# Protection
All fixed
