# Description
Start out on Signs of Life and continue up a 4 bolt overhanging extension. Once you get the first bolt clipped on the extension, work your way through a bouldery crux that seems to never end. As well as taking brute strength, this route also requires thought provoking beta to unlock a sequence of appropriate opposition.

Get down with a 60m as one pitch.

# Location
Extension to Signs of Life. Furthest established left route on the wall.

# Protection
5 quick-draws and 2 extended slings to help keep rope drag down.
