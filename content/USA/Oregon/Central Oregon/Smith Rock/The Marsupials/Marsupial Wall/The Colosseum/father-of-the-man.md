# Description
This is a very fun and worthy line. It starts with a 2 bolt Â boulder problem to get you to the flake. Hard climbing starts after the flake at the 6th. Here you can leave the no hands and go to the left or right of the bolt. Right is thinner, reachy and more direct. Left is more powerful. Pick your poison and take your medicine. Climb thru 2 core intensive shallow roofs to a pocket and crux face climbing passing the last bolt.

# Location
The Flake starting at the third bolt is most notable when trying to figure out which route is what. 10 meters left of Inglorious Bastard which goes out of cave.

# Protection
9 bolts
