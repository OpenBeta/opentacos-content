# Description
A well varied route for a face climb. The first 3 bolts build into an intimidating 2 bolt crux that is both baffling and a little runout. Iâ€™ve taken all the falls and they are safe with a good belay. The top is separated by a ledge followed by an arete. The top is probably a stand alone 12c with some really good movement!

# Location
Left of the cave on the right side of the crag. Stops on a slab next to the towering arete of Inglorious Bastard.

# Protection
9 bolts
