# Description
A good climb for those looking for a bouldery and technical challenge. Start out just to the right of Signs of Life (5.12-) on some big huecos. After the first 4 bolts, the rock quality improves dramatically as well as the difficulty of the climbing. A severely technical and crimpy crux on vert terrain will surly stop most,Â topped by a sequential slab.

# Location
Fixed yellow draws. Starts just right of Signs of Life and The Wailing Soul

# Protection
7 bolts. Fixed draws and steel anchors are fixed.
