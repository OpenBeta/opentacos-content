# Description
Stem your way to the starting holds in an awkward stance. Do some 5.11- moves to a hard crux passing the 3rd bolt and getting the 4th clipped. Then continue up engaging and thoughtful 5.11 climbing to a 3 bolt 5.12 crux at the end.

# Location
most left route on the wall as of right now.

# Protection
Fixed steel carabiners at the anchors. Some fixed draws
