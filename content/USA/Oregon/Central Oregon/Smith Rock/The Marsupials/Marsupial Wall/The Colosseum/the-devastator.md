The vertical climbing of Sun and Steel quickly changes passing the chains. A 30 degree Immediately start cranking right off the chains of Sun and Steel. Small holds lead to bigger holds and the flash pump becomes hard to manage. A stopper crux comes getting to the 3rd fixed draw of the extension. From here, it may be 12- to the chains with some big whip potential.

3rd most left route on the colosseum. Starts off on a flat vertical wall and leads to an overhang with 4 fixed draws. There is a route to the right that is could be confused with because they both have 4 fixed draws. It is the left of the 2

# Protection
Quickdraws for Sun and steel and a sling for the anchor.
