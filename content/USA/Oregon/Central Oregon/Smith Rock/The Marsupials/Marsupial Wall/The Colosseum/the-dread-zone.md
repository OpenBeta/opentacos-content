# Description
This route serves a pump that starts at the 4th bolt and doesn't end the top of the route. There is an obvious crux at the steep section between the 4th and 6th bolt. Big moves off awkwardly facing big holds make this surprisingly hard. (Get a close belay at the crux, the clips are hard.) The entire top of the route also has many sequence dependent cruxes with no great place to rest. This route shares some of its neighbors holds (The Onslaught) on the left for a 5 foot section towards the top. Mantle up on a ledge to clip the chains.

# Location
In the mist of a lot of routes. Starts off a boulder with a 2ft drop on the right and left of a giant flake/crack system

# Protection
No fixed draws right now. 5th should be fixed for future ascents. Anchors have steel carabiners.
