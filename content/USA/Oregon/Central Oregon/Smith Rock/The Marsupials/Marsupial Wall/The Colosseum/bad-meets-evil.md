# Description
Great technique and fingers of steel are the key to this vertical route. Go through an awkward seam to a crux pulling onto a scoop half way up the route. Expect a tough clip on the slab. Work through a couple roofs to a heartbreaking crux at the end. This route saves the hardest moves for last!!

# Location
Starts in a rounded seam and ends above 2 distinct roofs above a dihedral.

# Protection
8 bolts and fixed steel carabiners at the anchors
