# Description
Start out on an obvious flake for 2 bolts of climbing that gives way to a long and desolate vertical face. After the 3rd bolt is clipped, there is 3 cruxes that are around v5, all stacked, with no great rest. (Make sure to go right after the 4th bolt. It could easily be linked into the route to the left.) The climbing never seems to let off technically or physically until a deep pump is set in. Eventually the route links into a giant flake for some arete moves. There is a little slab crux saved for the end with limited hand holds.

# Location
Starts 2 routes to the right of the Alex Reed Memorial Route. Start off a giant flake and go right after the 4th bolt.

# Protection
8 bolts long. 4th and 6th bolts are fixed.  Anchors are fixed with steel carabiners
