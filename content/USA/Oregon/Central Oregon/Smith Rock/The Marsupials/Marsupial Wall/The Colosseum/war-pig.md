# Description
This highly featured route demands a variety of technical and styles to succeed. Start off on some hollow flakes and work into a massive undercling rail. Work some magic to find opposition through the roof and onto the taxing face. Next comes the holdless overhanging dihedral followed by a redpoint crux pulling the roof, maybe just the crux in general. Finish on a couple bolts of low angle climbing to the anchor above the ledge.

# Location
Starts off the flakes on the right side of the cave, on the right side of the wall. Work out left after clipping the first bolt and continue up the line of bolts. Currently the 2nd right most route on the wall

# Protection
9 bolts and a fixed anchor. First 3 bolts are not always fixed and neither are the last couple
