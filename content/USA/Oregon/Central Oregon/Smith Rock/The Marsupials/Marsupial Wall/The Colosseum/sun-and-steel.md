# Description
Classic smith rocks crux start on a vert wall that slowly turns slightly slabby as you gain elevation. A crumbly slabby middle seen from the ground, is the only part of the route that isnt as mentally engaging. The top half of the route has a great section that forces slab technique on solid 5.11 climbing.

# Location
Start to the right of Symptom of the universe (massive arete on the left of the wall). It is the most left route that goes up the vertical section of the coliseum.

# Protection
7 bolts and fixed anchors with steel carabiners
