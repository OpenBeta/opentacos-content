# Description
Start out of the center of the overhanging sector on the right side of the wall. A couple brutal moves off under clingsÂ lead to some flat edges. The beginning is probably around v8 by itself. Get to a couple no hands rest in-between some powerful 5.12 cruxes before the finally. One last no hands before a 15m 5.13 extension. A crimp ladder at the top seems impossible with the weight of the rope pulling down and a hard to manage pump. I had to skip the last bolt to make it happen

# Location
Left route of the small overhang on the right side of the entire wall

# Protection
Bolted. 22 fixed steel cable draws.
