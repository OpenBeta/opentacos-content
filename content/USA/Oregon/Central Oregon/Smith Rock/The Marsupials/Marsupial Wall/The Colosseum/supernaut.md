# Description
"I want to reach out and touch the sky

I want to touch the sun but I don't need to fly

I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon"

-Black Sabbath

From under this route, there's a lot of doubt looking up at the looming overhang. 35 meters up, a steep bulge jets out that looks featureless.

With fingers of steel, climb the thin crux of Holy Smoke and continue past the first set of anchors. Above the anchors is a crux that rivals the lower parts difficulty if climbed right. A lot of moderate climbing leads to a memorable redpoint crux at the lip of the overhang!

(80m required for single lower out)

# Location
