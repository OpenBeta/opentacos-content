# Description
Very Very typical Smith climbing. Technical and not to steep overall, this route stays with you to the chains. Lower crux is at the between 4th and 6th bolt. It starts going out left side of roof and doing a big move to get over it. Going right under roof puts you on a no hands ledge. This was not the intended way but if your tall it goes. This softens the grade too. Save a little for the 2nd crux going to the 10th bolt. Mostly great red/salmon colored rock. Protected great where you need it with a dash of spice where you don't. It's a great addition to the wall. I expect this route will see a lot a traffic in the future.
