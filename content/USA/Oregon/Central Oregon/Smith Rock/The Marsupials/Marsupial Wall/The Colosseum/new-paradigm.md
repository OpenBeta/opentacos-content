# Description
First three bolts are easily climbed but things change at the fourth. Here the thin crux starts and stays thin and engaging for two more bolts. Find the no hands stem and rest for the bouldery sequence pulling onto the slab at bolt nine. Be sure to stay right once your hands are on the slab. Follow the last couple bolts up easier terrain with lesser quality rock to the chains.
