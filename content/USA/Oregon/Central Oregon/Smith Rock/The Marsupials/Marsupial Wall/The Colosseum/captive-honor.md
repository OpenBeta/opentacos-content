# Description
Start out just to the right of the Alex Reed Memorial route. There's not getting around the sheer crimp strength needed for this route, but knowing where all the hand holds helps a lot. The climbing turns on quick at the 2nd bolt and doesn't seem to let up until the 5th bolt is clipped. The top half still proves to be a challenge in itself, although it is much easier.

# Location
start off a fractured flake that links the start of this route and the Alex Reed Memorial Route

# Protection
8 bolts
