# Description
A 32m voyage up dead vert climbing onto a giant arete on great rock the entire way! Â A nonstop boulder problem that doesn't seem to ever end on the vert wall. About half way up a massive 7 bolt arete contiues to the top. A heartbreaker crux lies just above the last bolt.

# Location
Start out of the cave located on the right side of the Colosseum. Inglorious Bastard starts on the left side and quickly gets onto the vert wall.

# Protection
All fixed
