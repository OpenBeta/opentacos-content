# Description
Crux probably comes just getting to the second bolt climbing good rock in a small dihedral. Then continue up the face until you pull onto a ledge. Off the ledge, clip the first bolt with a long sling and start up a 10+ crack caped by a 5.11- crux on steep rock featuring jugs! Then mantle onto another ledge and continue up suspect rock on 5.9 climbing.

# Location
Left most route on the wall right of the corner.

# Protection
10 quickdraws plus anchors
