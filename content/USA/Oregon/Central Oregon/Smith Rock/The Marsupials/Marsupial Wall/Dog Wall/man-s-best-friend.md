# Description
Man's Best Friend takes an alternate route after the crux of the third pitch of Adventure Dog. From the belay of the third pitch, look up at the daunting roof systems and get ready to tackle them head on! After the fourth bolt, continue straight to the apex of the roof and get ready for a short lived 11+ crux on perfect welded tough. After clearing the 2nd roof, head straight left to link back into Adventure Dog. Climb 5.5 climbing to the adventure dog anchors and choose to lower to the anchors below or top out.

For more information on the starting pitches, refer to Adventure Dog on mountain project.
