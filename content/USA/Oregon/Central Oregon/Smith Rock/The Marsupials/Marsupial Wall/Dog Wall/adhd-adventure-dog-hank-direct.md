# Description
You'd have be an Attention Deficit sport crimper to choose this over the standard start to Adventure Dog.

Start ten feet to the right of the standard Adventure Dog start and crimp your way past four bolts to a convenience anchor for cragging, or continue up the multi-pitch climb, Adventure Dog.

# Location
Far right side of Marsupial Wall on a flat, crimpy, face.  Just right of the standard start to Adventure Dog.

# Protection
four bolts to the first anchor.  Add another eight draws if linking with the second pitch of Adventure Dog.
