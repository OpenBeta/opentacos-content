# Description
A 210 foot, bolted journey to the top of the Marsupial Wall.  All three pitches of Adventure Dog offer sustained 5.10 climbing, mostly solid rock, and impressive position...

P1 5.10+ 45ft. 5 bolts. Starts in a lighter colored rock scar and concave feature on the right side of Marsupial Wall.  Sustained stemming in an open corner and seam leads to an optional anchor for single pitch cragging, or step up and right to a chain anchor below the second pitch of Adventure Dog (45 feet). Or, for full value, skip both anchors and continue another 70 ft to Adventure Dog's second pitch anchor. (115 feet).

Variation A, (ADHD 5.11.a)- start 10 feet to the right, on a crimpy face.

Variation B- (Old Dog 5.6 R) start 40 feet to the right, just right of the shrubby Juniper, then angle up and left past two bolts.

P2 5.10+ 70ft. 7 bolts.  Angle up and left toward a steep corner.  Crank up the overhanging corner (crux) and continue directly up the steep and juggy face to a chain anchor. A single, 70m rope reaches the ground from this anchor.

P3 5.10+ 100ft. 8 bolts. Pulls two bulges way off the deck, an epic pitch!  Continue straight up and take caution clipping the first two bolts.  Make a long reach past the first overhang (crux). Keep motoring on good holds and steep terrain as you angle left while passing the upper bulge.  Lower on chains to the anchor atop pitch 2, or continue to the top of the wall and anchor off a Juniper tree.

# Location
A prominent, 70-foot fin jutting out from the upper right side of the wall makes a good landmark.  Adventure Dog climbs the face to the left of the prominent fin.

# Protection
Rack of quickdraws.  Two rappels from chain anchors with a single, 70m rope.
