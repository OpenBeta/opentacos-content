# Description
Start a long voyage up Hong Kong Phooey to the right of Call of the Wild. Hike your feet up past the first bolt through some bouldery moves. After the 4th bolt, run it out on 5.5 climbing to the 5th bolt. Then begin the sustained wall as it changes aspect. After the 8th bolt, do 5.11 climbing spaced above bolts. Falls are safe but it can feel quite sporty. After the 11th bolt, pull onto another ledge and continue up another overhanging section to the anchors, probably around 5.11-here. A heady lead!

# Location
right of Call of the Wild

# Protection
13 bolts + anchor setup.
