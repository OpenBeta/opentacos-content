# Description
Start off a rock platform and travers a dike up and left for 2 bolts. Climb through some featured rock to a small overhang. A vert wall above the overhang will keep you on your toes. Don't get sucked out to the right bolt line, a jug between the routes makes it easy to do if you don't pay attention. The routes are close but the climbing is independent.

(A redtag may still be on this route for the linkup that moves onto the route left of the roof. Please stay off the linkup if the redtag isn't moved, i can't remember if i moved it yet. I will delete this when I move it. Enjoy the route in the meanwhile)

# Location
Start off the right side of a large rock feature. Traverse a system of underclings on a dike for two bolts.

# Protection
Fully bolted. Fixed steel carabiners at anchors
