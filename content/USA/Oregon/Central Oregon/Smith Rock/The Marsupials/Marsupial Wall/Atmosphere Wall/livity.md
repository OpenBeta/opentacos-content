# Description
A good warmup for the harder routes on the wall or for aspiring 5.11 climbers. With a bolt every body length, this climb isn't very mentally committing like most the 5.11 at smith. There is a few thought provoking cruxes that keep a pump going for most of the route. Climb a few feet above the last bolt to get to the chains on insecure climbing climbing.

# Location
Most left route on the wall.

# Protection
Bolts with steel carabiner on anchors
