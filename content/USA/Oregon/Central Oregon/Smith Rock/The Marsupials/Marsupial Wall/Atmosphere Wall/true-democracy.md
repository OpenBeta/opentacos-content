# Description
Start a few feet left of a small boulder and work into a crack below the first bolt. A methodical 5.11 vertical section continues until the final 2 bolts, where the power sapping overhanging climbing begins. Although its a short crux, it sure packs a pump!

# Location
Starts right of a small boulder. Climbs into a crack below the first bolt.

# Protection
8 bolts with fixed carabiners on anchor. 1 steel draw fixed at the crux
