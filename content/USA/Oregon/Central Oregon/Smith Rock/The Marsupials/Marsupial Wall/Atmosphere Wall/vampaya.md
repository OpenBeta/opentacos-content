# Description
Starts off the right side of a large rock on the ground. Pull onto a dike and go straight up the bolt line above. A small traverse down low can be trivial, but the true crux come at the last 3 bolts. Get ready for some intense vertical climbing to a powerful overhang.

# Location
Start off the right side of a large rock and follow the bolt line that goes up instead of an early traverse. Climbs into a shallow overhanging dihedral at the end

# Protection
No fixed draws but steel carabiners are fixed at anchors
