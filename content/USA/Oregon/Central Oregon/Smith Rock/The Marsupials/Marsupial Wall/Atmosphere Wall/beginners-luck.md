# Description
This route will throw some qualified climbers for a loop. As typical for smith, do a crux move getting off the ground to the first bolt and enjoy some quality rock and thoughtful movement. Above the 4th bolt, climb into a big cave. Finding a way out of the cave can be tricky, but alt lest it is well protected. At the 7th bolt, veer to the right and skip the 5.11 bulge.

# Location
3rd most right route.

# Protection
Fixed anchor with steel carabiner. no fixed draws 10 bolts
