# Description
This route starts out on conveniently placed cheater stones at the base of the climb. Start with the first bolt clipped, for the crux of the route lies within the first 15â€™ of climbing. Pull onto the overhung wall and crank on good cobbles and crimps working your way up to a good jug. Clear the roof and work your way up onto a pumpy face. Clear the face and work into a shallow dihedral or squeeze and compress straight up the column itself (I think this was the intended beta). The difficultly in climbing diminishes the higher you get. Clip the anchors on jugs.

# Location
This route is located on the far right side of Brogan Spire.

# Protection
8 bolts, 2 anchors.
