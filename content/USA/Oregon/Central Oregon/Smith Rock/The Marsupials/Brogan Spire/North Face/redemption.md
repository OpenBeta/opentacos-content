# Description
Climb through a couple 5.11 bulges to good rests. Then into the endurance crux starting at the 6th bolt on a crimp rail followed by a big move. The climbing eases up at the last couple bolts but a severe pump could devastate ones day.

# Location
A slew of new route went up on the left side of brogan spire. This one starts off by stepping off the right side of a large boulder onto a 5.5 slab to the first bolt.

# Protection
10 bolts. fixed anchors with steel carabiners
