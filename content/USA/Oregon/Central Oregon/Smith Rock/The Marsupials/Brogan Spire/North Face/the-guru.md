# Description
Perfect rock from bottom to top with engaging moves the entire way. A majority of the climb involves working a seam system, but some featured moves on big holds start the route and appear in the middle of the route. The crux starts under the 2nd to last bolt and doesn't let up until the chains. It is a long way to climb for such a heartbreaking finish!

# Location
Starts in the middle of the lower terraces to the right of pouches and eternal stoke.

# Protection
Fixed draws from the 3rd bolt up. Anchors have steel carabiners
