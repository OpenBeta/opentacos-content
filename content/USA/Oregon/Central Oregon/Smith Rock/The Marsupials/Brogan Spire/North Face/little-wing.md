# Description
Just next to Charcoal Fighter is a 25ft overhanging arete that shoots out off a right facing dihedral under a highly features headwall capped by a little overhanging section. The crux starts right off the ground and doesn't let up until the 4th bolt clipped. Some unique and creative body positioning will make this feel more doable. From the 4th bolt, enjoy less trivial 5.10+ climbing all the way to the chains.

# Location
Just to the right of charcoal fighter. And obvious arete shoots out off a right facing dihedral

# Protection
Fully bolted with steel carabiners at the chains
