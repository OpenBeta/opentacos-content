# Description
This tall route begins on the face between two caves. Pass a cool bulge at the 4th bolt and run up an easy slab. After a reachy move, face a tricky transition into the steep seam, then the pump builds on good holds to the top.

# Location
Far left side of the amphitheater on Brogan's NW face.

# Protection
13 bolts. 60m rope works but knot the end
