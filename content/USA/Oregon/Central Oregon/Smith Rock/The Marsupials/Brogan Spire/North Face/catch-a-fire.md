# Description
Start of a flat chockstone ledge and head up the slab to a ledge above the first bolt. Do a hard boulder problem off the ledge (falls are totally clean although it seems scary to go for it) and gain access to another slab. From here the climb gets progressively harder until your running it out to the chains. The most overhanging section of the climb is the hardest by far.

Prepare yourself for battle!

# Location
Starts off a flat chockstone on the left side of the slab. Belayer stays on the flat ground before the chockstone scramble.

# Protection
9 bolts and fixed steel carabiners on chains
