# Description
An obvious line that starts next to Pouches on a seam. It ends up sharing a couple holds with pouches before the crux, but it quickly cuts out left after the shared holds.

It starts with a wicked v4/5 crux at the first couple bolts and eases up until the real crux at the 7th bolt, which could be as hard as v8, but I'm a terrible judge for the V grading system, just know its hard AF! Another crux comes directly after the 8th bolt but is definitely easier than the first. Finish on pumpy 5.11 climbing to the chains.

(Continue into Pouches for a great 12a!)

# Location
Left left of Pouches and starts off a seam. Stick clip is nice but not necessary.

# Protection
Bolts! not fixed draws right now, but the anchors have steel carabiners.
