# Description
From the ground, this seems like the most intimidating of the seams on the upper section of Brogan spire. Great rock quality leads all the way up to a well cleaned slab finish. Start on a slab and tackle consistently harder bulges until the crux at the 3rd bulge. Some tricky moves follow the crux before the slab. Â It may be dramatically easier for taller folks.

# Location
Furthest right route that starts on the slab. Belay does not have a backseat of a boulder to lounge while belaying, that is Burning n Looting.

# Protection
Bolts with fixed steel carabiners on anchors
