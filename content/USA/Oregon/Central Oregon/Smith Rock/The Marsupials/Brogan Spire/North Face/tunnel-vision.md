# Description
If pouches was to easy for you, then this 5.12- intro will bump it up a couple notches. Do a hard crux low and enter into the pouches crux with a little extra pump! This route climbs the entire seam that pouches ends on. Perfect bullet proof rock from bottom to top! A possible classic for its great rock and thoughtful movement.

# Location
Just left of pouches. Climb the seam that leads into the end of pouches

# Protection
Bolts with steel carabiners on anchor
