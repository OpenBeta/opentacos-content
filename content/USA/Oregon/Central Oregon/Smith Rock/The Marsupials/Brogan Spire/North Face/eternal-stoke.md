# Description
Eternal Stoke starts out just to the right of Pouches. Start out on ok holds working your way up the gently overhanging face. The somewhat juggy beginning gives way to a mini crux pulling off a good 2 finger pocket. Arrive at a huge jug and get a good shake before entering the crux of the route. Pull the crux, make a couple more moves and arrive at a good ledge to clip. Do a couple more technical moves heading toward the clipping jug of Pouches, keep moving up and right up to the new set of anchors.

Edit: This route has been upgraded, adding 2 more bolts to the route and extending it up another 20’ feet. Sorry for your redpoint or onsight... But were takin’ it back!

The upgrades added to this route make it the full experience it should be. Enjoy.
