# Description
This brutally bouldery route serves a couple moves that may add up to v8! Climbs through good rock all the way to the chain, but the bouldery nature of this route may scare many away. Pull over a couple bulges to find yourself under a perplexing crux that is lacking holds. Although the holds are good, they either facing the wrong direction or are too far apart.

# Location
Start off a flat chockstone that staircases to a giant boulder to the left. The route shares the start with the Uprising but then branches left.

# Protection
8 bolts
