# Description
Ambush in the Night is one of the coolest 5.12a’s at Smith Rock. Start out climbing clearing two bouldery bulges setting you up on the upper portion of the route. Power layback your way up the route with having the opportunity to sink in killer knee bars along the way! The crux comes after a rest at a huge jug. The climbing eases past the crux with fun climbing to the anchors.

# Location
This route is located on the left side of the amphitheater. The climbing starts from the ground floor behind a giant boulder.

# Protection
11 bolts, fixed anchors
