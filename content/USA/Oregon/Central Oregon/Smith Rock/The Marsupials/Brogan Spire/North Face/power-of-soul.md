# Description
Get your feet onto the hanging wall and begin a brutal boulder sequence on small nobs and chicken heads. Get the third bolt clipped and traverse out left onto the rest of Power of Soul. A heady clip is followed up by the stand alone crux getting in and out of the dihedral.

# Location
Just left of Charcoal Fighter on the overhanging steep wall. No cheater rock stack for this one.

# Protection
10 bolts. 4 are fixed at the cruxs
