# Description
Climb through a cruxy bulge passing the 2nd bolt to gain access to the slab. From here, enjoy some fun juggy climbing until you reach a stopper crux at the lip of the overhang. The crux is powerful, yet very precise and beta intensive. Should be on the list for anyone who likes bouldery routes, its really a fun route to climb!

(Stick clipping a draw on the second bolt is a good idea for shorter folks (5.10 and under). A long sling on the first bolt is necessary to keep rope drag reasonable. An extended draw at the 4th and 5th bolt will also helps with drag but isn't completely necessary.

# Location
Begin off a flat chockstone on the right side of a massive boulder that almost touches the cliff. Go up 4 bolts and branch up and right.

# Protection
7 bolts. Anchors are fixed with steel carabiners.
