# Description
A good warm-up for the harder stuff on Brogan Spire's north face and worth doing if you are in the area. Â Stays in the shade til 3pm. Climb the vertical wall past mediocre rock to a featured slab. The real fun comes on the juggy finish, climbing steeper terrain than most Smith 5.10s.

# Location
Next to a prominent corner left of the Brogan Spire/Mini Half Dome notch, three routes right of Charcoal Fighter.

# Protection
8 bolts
