# Description
Start on the first 4 bolts of Power of Soul and goÂ into the finish of charcoal fighter instead of going left. 4 bolts of powerful V7 climbing to a 5.11 finish. Pull up off two crimps at the lip of the cave to get started. Work some chicken heads and crimps to an even harder boulder problem passing the 4th bolt. From here, the climbing eases dramatically. No cheater rock stacks on this one for the full grade.

# Location
Starts just left of Charcoal Fighter

# Protection
9 bolts, 3rd is fixed and anchors are fixed with steel carabiners
