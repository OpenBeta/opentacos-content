# Description
Bold as Love goes straight up through some of the highest quality rock that smith rock has to offer. A steep and bouldery crux leads to an onslaught of pump! Fight a growing pump until you reach a stopper one move crux at the anchors.

# Location
Starts off the lowest terrace at Brogan Spire. Two routes to the left of the Frenchmen's Route.

# Protection
Fixed draws and steel carabiners on anchors
