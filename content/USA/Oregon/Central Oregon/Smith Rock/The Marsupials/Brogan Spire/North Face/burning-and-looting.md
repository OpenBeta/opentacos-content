# Description
A very unique route with lots of different styles on great rock. Begin your voyage on the right side of the slab, working past a small roof. Tackle the first crux at the 4th bolt. Climb up to a massive overhanging block that is fractured. Enjoy a killer view from the ledge before the final dash for the chains! Stay left for the last 2 bolts, thereâ€™s a variation out right in the work.

# Location
Started under a small roof on the right side a the slab of the amphitheater.

# Protection
14 bolts with steel carabiners at the anchors.
