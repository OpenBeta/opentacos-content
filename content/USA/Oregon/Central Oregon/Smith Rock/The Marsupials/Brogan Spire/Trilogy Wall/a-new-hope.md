# Description
Starts out with a hard 5.11+ boulder pull to gain access to the 5.10 slab. Getting the 4th bolt clipped is committing although easy if climbed proper. Climb to the 6 bolt as the climbing begins to build a pump. After a couple decent rest at the 2nd to last bolt, tackle the steep balancy and powerful headwall on marginal crimps.

# Location
Left most route on Brogan Spire

# Protection
10 bolts. Anchors are fixed with steel carabiners.
