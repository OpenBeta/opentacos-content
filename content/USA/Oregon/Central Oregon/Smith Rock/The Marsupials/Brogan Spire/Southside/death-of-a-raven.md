# Description
This route is different from the norm at Smith. Expect good jugs and pockets the whole way. The crux would probably be the pump from the overhang.

# Location
The only Bolted route on the south side of the ampitheater or about 50 yards uphill and left of the start of Barred Reality.

# Protection
9 Bolts. Anchors. Rap or continue to summit.
