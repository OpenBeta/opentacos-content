# Description
Smith's version of Stolen Chimney on Ancient Art.

Easy climbing to an airy summit makes for a worthy mini adventure.

Pitch 1: What used to be a 5.6 solo has now been bolted. Climb a short steep section to a slab above and end at a bolted anchor or continue to the tunnel.

Pitch 2: Continue up to a tunnel through the formation, climb through the tunnel and turn right. Follow a run out groove (couple of bolts) to the shoulder above and belay at a bolted anchor. 5.3-5.6

Pitch 3: The goods. Climb easy rock to the summit spire and enjoy the view. 5.4

Descent: Rap the route with two ropes

# Location
start in an alcove on the East side of the formation. there are three short and overhanging sport climbs just left of the start of this route.

Approach by hiking past Koala Rock to a chimney between Brogan Spire's south end and Mini Half Dome (5.0) then turn up hill and hike along the base of the formation and pass through a tunnel where a large block leans against the face. The alcove is just above there.

# Protection
small rack and draws
