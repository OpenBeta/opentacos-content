# Description
"After a powerful boulder problem off the ground, tricky moves on weird looking rock lead to a beautiful slab. Climb the simple slab past widely spaced bolts to an anchor on a large ledge. Another boulder problem leads past two bolts to a second anchor. The third pitch climbs from the hole in The Cave Route straight up the featured slab to the summit. Rappel The Cave Route." -- Rod Jacobson's Smith Rock '09 Supplement

Double rope rappel from last anchor. DO NOT RAPPEL FROM 1st OR 2nd BELAY STATIONS AS YOUR ROPES WILL GET STUCK!!!

# Location
At the base of the wall/buttress, before the turn the corner that takes you through the cave and up to the sport routes and Cave Route's start.

# Protection
1st pitch: 9 bolts; 2nd pitch: 2 bolts; 3rd pitch: bolts
