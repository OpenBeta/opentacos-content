# Description
A single route ascends the main spire's south wall. Begin atop a small boulder, crank a crux move right off the deck, and climb some of Smith's most massive huecos to the shelf below the summit. The rock would be better if it saw more traffic. Rappel off with two ropes or continue to the top via the West Face.
