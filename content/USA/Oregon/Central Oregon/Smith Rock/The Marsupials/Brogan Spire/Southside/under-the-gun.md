# Description
Short but fun overhanging jugs. This is a great intro to the grade if the climber lacks technique but has a little muscle. It's sharp but the holds are great. Crux is about 3/4ths the way up the route with a little reachy balancy move.

# Location
if you've already found the hidden wall, it's the second from the left.

# Protection
4 Bolts. Anchors. Rap.
