# Description
Start off the ledge with 6 clips of on-your-feet 5.11- climbing. Then the angle tips back a few degrees and a distinct crux comes above the 7th bolt with a wild move to a jug.

Similar to the smooth pockety rock on Babylon Wall, Smith Rock's version of limestone. Shade until 2pm. The setting on this ledge is spectacular, a great place to hang out and try a secluded project.

# Location
On the huge ledge after the second pitch of Birds in a Rut. Follows a gray water streak, left of Endless Weekend.

# Protection
8 bolts
