# Description
This former bolt ladder-to-nowhere is now a respectable free climb. The start liebacks up an offset seam to a technical crux section midway up on a slab of great rock. Move right to better holds, then make a pumpy pocketed traverse left to the roof, clearing this final hurdle to reach the anchor.

# Location
Right side of the Wombat west facing base area, on the clean panel of tan rock.

# Protection
12 bolts
