# Description
Leaving the first anchor, set up on underclings and face a minor crux. Shake out and set up on left-facing holds before the business. Enter a sustained hard section with poor holds, intricate footwork and a difficult clip or two. This leads up onto the airy arete and just as the climbing eases, a wicked pump settles in until you pull onto a great ledge 35 meters off the ground.

# Location
Center of the Wombat's base wall, climbs the small arete on dark red rock up high

# Protection
16 bolts total including first anchor. Good to have an extended draw on the first bolt of the extension.

70 meter rope or lower to the first anchor with a 60m
