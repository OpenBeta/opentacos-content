# Description
Starting with one and a half pitches of a former bolt ladder, and continuing on to the top of the Thumb, this route ranks among the better multipitch lines at Smith.

P1: Bolts Anonymous 5.12b, 115 feet 15 bolts. Technical slab edging to a roof. Continue past the single pitch lowering anchor for 3 more bolts of 5.10 to a 2-bolt belay on a small ledge.

P2: 5.11b, 115 feet, 14 bolts. This long beauty climbs straight up throught a variety of different corners on great rock. Pass a rap anchor under a roof halfway up and finish at a slab stance.

P3: 5.12c, 70 feet, 10 bolts. The well-protected crux offers a nice contrast in styles to the first pitch. Power out a steep overlap of smooth red stone with underclings and a boulder problem to reach the lip. Two more bolts of easy climbing brings you to a good ledge.

P4: 5.10b, 30 feet, 4 bolts. Mini-pitch to the summit. Move up and right onto the arete, clip the anchor and go stand on top of the Thumb to complete the ascent. Enjoy the position up there before lowering back to the ledge, or all the way down to the top of P2, making a small swing right to reach the anchor.

Descent: Set up to rap with a single 60m rope. From the top of P2, make 3 rappels using the intermediate chain anchor. With 2 60m ropes you can skip this station and rap straight to the P1 anchor, then another 30m rap to the ground.
