# Description
Start on good incuts, then some 5.10 moves above the first bolt moving into the scoop. The route offers great steep climbing on cool green stone. A series of varied cruxes in the second half build all the way to the final bulge, pulling over on crimps to an anchor that sits about a mile above the main area at Smith.

Morning shade, afternoon sun.

# Location
Left side of the Wombat's base wall, look for some huecos 30 feet up

# Protection
11 bolts to an anchor on the slab. Small stick clip is a good idea.
