# Description
Mixed route that starts up a corner and along a roof (.10a) to an intermediate anchor. Start clipping bolts as you climb the crux stem and edge section, finally moving around the arete to a lichen-jug finish.

# Location
Left facing corner on the Wombat's giant lower ledge, on the way to the Santiam Highway Ledges route. There is a great living room-sized cave hangout right of the route that stays shaded most of the day.

# Protection
Single cams up to BD #1 with slings the first half, 7 bolts for the second half
