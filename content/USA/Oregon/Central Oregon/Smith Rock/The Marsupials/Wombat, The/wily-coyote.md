# Description
The most difficult climbing comes in the first 5 bolts of vertical rock, including a bouldery start and big moves on pinches and knobs. The second half of the route eases up but still offers thoughtful movement.

A large coyote was observed traversing the slope directly below this wall during the first ascent.

# Location
Right side of the green wall at the Wombat's base

# Protection
10 bolts, small stick clip recommended
