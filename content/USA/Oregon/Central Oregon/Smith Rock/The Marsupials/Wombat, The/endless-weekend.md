# Description
Short line of gently overhanging jugs. Fun route to squeeze in while climbing or descending the nearby route, "Birds in a Rut."

# Location
This route is found on the right side of a large ledge system on the Wombat's northwest face. The best approach follows the first two pitches of "Birds in a Rut." To descend to the base, walk down to an anchor on the right side of the lowest ledge and rappel with a single rope.

# Protection
5 Bolts
