# Description
On the uphill east side of the wombat. Look for the obvious weakness to gain the summit. Follow a short 15ft wide crack then follow the slab up and right to the ridge take this to the summit.

Note: In the watts guide he says that its a simple 4th class scramble up the summit ride. I found it to be a bit more invovled than most 4th class scrambles.

# Location
On the north eastern uphill side of the wombat.

# Protection
Its possible to bring a tiny rack to 3" but there are no anchors in place on the summit, though you could probably sling a block.
