# Description
Short route with a unique crux just before the anchors. creativity will help in unlocking this delicate crux. The route is still cleaning up a bit so don't be surprised if something breaks on you. Still, I felt it to be worth roping up for if your already over there.

# Location
South side of the Delirium Tremens block. Look for the arete on the southwest corner.

# Protection
4 Bolts. Anchors. Rap.
