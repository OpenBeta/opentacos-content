# Description
Are you way out in the marsupials, but all the easy routes on Koala are taken by a big Mazama crew? There is an unknown named 5.8 ish route on Delirium Tremens.  A fun little warm-up before tackling the sweet 10b crack you can't stop looking at right next to you.  You could also use it to rig a top rope for the crack, or that super thin 5.12a.

Go climb this thing and clean the rock up more!  It needs it at the moment, but should come into its own after more laps.

If you bolted this and/or got the first ascent, speak up!  This was a good addition to the area.

# Location
2 routes right of Delirium Tremens crack.  Shiny new bolts on this thing.  Hard to miss.  Stays in the shade till the afternoon

# Protection
7 or 8 bolts, Odd chain anchor
