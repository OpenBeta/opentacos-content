# Description
This route starts with fairly large slightly sloping edges (fun crux) and gets a good shake at third bolt. It continues on edges and a lie back or two to a finishing easy slab.

# Location
On the south side closer to the mud pile. It’s the only vertical sport line on that side.

# Protection
7 bolts. Anchors. Rap rings.
