# Description
The Alchemist features some of the best rock Smith Rock has to offer off the monkey. Perfect red stone leads all the way to the top of the route.

The first 4 bolts are where the meat of the climb is, but there is also a crux pulling onto the slab passing the last bolt, a technical heartbreaker! Start out pulling over a small roof (the crux is pulling off the ground) then keep climbing at a sustained level of difficulty on the arete till the 5th bolt is clipped. Then get ready for a crux that is hard to read if you haven't already climbed the route.
