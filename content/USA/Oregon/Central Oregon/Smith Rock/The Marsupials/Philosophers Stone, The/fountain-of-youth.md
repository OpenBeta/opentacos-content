# Description
Still has a red tag on the first bolt for the traverse after the 3rd bolt. The straight up line (Fountain of Youth 5.11c) is open but not the traverse out right. Ill change this once i move the redtag and get the traverse ready to go. In the meanwhile, check out this new amazing 5.11.

Test your youthful boldness, clipping the first bolt 20ft off the deck atop a giant flake. Once off the flake, sustained 5.11- climbing on perfect red stone and increasingly spaced protection leads to a finishing crux leaving a good rest. Don't wonder out right after the last bolt.

# Location
Off the giant flake in the center of the Philosopher stone.

# Protection
7 bolts. Anchors are fixed with steel carabiners
