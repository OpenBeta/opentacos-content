# Description
Start out of easy climbing to the first high bolt, and begin the 5.11 climbing. This route will test your head as you climb past the lower crux into easy terrain to clip the spaced 3rd bolt. Although it looks scary from the ground, it make sense when you climb it and is safe with a good belay. The rock on this route is really good and the upper crux has some very unique moves.

Also, you can set up a top-rope for the 5.12c from the anchor.

# Location
The route is right of the right arete on the left side of the philosopher stone

# Protection
4 bolts to anchors fixed with steel carabiners.
