# Description
The Stem Cell will surely get the attention of avid climbers at first sight. A prominent dihedral rises with a slightly overhanging dihedral of desert varnish on the right and a good red welded tough on the left wall with bulging overhangs.

A good stem climber will use every trick in the book to try to muster up this climb. This one will test one's crack climbing and stemming abilities.

All in all, I would say this is a great climb! the rock quality is good and the movement is fun and unique. Feels like a hard trad climb with bolts due to the flaky nature of the crack.

# Location
Far left on the Philosophers Stone. Starts in an obvious dihedral on 5.7 climbing which quickly gets easier.

# Protection
4 lead bolts and 2 anchor bolts
