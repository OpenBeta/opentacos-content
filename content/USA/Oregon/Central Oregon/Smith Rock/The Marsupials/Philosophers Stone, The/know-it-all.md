# Description
Start out on perfect red stone under a small slanting dihedral. After the first bolt is clipped, technically engaging climbing lets up at the 4th bolt before a good rest on a ledge. After the 3rd bolt, the rock quality is less than perfect but leaves a few more cruiser moves to the chains.

# Location
Right side of the left side of the philosopher stone. Goes straight up just to the left of Bitter Ending

# Protection
5 bolts. Anchors are fixed with steel carabiners
