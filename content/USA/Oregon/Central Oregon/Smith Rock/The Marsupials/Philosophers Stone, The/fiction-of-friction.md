# Description
Start out of good rock to a high 1st bolt on moderate climbing. Once past the 2nd bolt, begin to work whatever trickery you can come up with to get through the frictionless crux section. Once you get the 1st bolt that joins the routes clipped at at your knees of a jug, cut left and enter the last crux of the Faction of Traction for good style. The path will naturally avoid this last crux but its worth doing. Either way, 12c!

# Location
4th furthest route to the left. Share anchors with its neighbor, faction of traction.
