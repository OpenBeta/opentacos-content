# Description
This was the first line bolted on The Philosopher's Stone. The crux comes passing the first bolt and getting established to clip the second bolt. This is where the PG-13 rating comes from. With a good belay, it is safe, but it is good to be on your toes getting to where you clip the 2nd bolt.

The entire route features red rock that is perfect. The rock doesn't crumble or break even though it is not well traveled. After the first arete crux, climb through a few bolts of 5.11 before the final crux passing the last bolt to the anchors. Work a couple gastones to get to a sloper to clip the anchors at your waist or clip low off the gastone.

# Location
Left side of The Philosopher's Stone.

# Protection
5 bolts and anchors.
