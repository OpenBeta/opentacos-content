# Description
This loose looking line will surprise most with its great movement and deceptively cohesive rock. Start out a large terrace from the left and climb through some 5.10 climbing to the 3 bolt. Clipping the 3rd bolt is exciting, so be ready for that. After you get the 3rd bolt clipped, the climbing to the anchors is where the climb earns its 11+ grade. A good arete climber will find the line of least resistance easily while others will struggle.

# Location
Right of Stem Cell on the arete.

# Protection
5 bolts, fixed anchors with steel carabiners
