# Description
Start off the ground on the crux, a cranker lie-back to edges. Start off the giant flake to make the start a bit easier, it might bump the grade down. After the 2nd bolt is clipped, sustained climbing leads to the last bolt for a final crux that makes the climb! I don't want to give away anymore!

# Location
Starts left of the giant flake that Fountain of Youth starts off of.

# Protection
7 bolts, last bolt is fixed as well as anchors with steel carabiners
