# Description
Goes up great looking stone with technical movement and powerful sections passing the 2nd and 4th bolt. Great movement, but the rock quality in parts needs traffic to clean up. A worthwhile climb!

# Location
right side of the left side of the philosopher stone. Starts by a ledge as you traverse out right to the first bolt.

# Protection
5 bolts with fixed steel carabiners on the anchors.
