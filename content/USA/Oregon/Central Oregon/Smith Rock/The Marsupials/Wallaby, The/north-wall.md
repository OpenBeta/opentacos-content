# Description
Starts on easy unprotected terrain untill you hit the end of the slab. Bolted climbing continues up the face and to the ladge beneath the summit. The guide book says that there is a belay here but you can also clip the single spinner bolt and continue around the backside of the block and up to the top. Don't fall making the mantle to the top. Ropedrag is pretty harsh but can be somewhat fixed once you're at the anchors by throwing the rope back around the corner.

# Location
This route is on the north side of the spire. Look for a low angle ramp that leads to the only bolt line on the spire.

# Protection
8 bolts. Anchors. Rap.
