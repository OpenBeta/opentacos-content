# Description
Start on top of the 15' boulder around the corner from the start of Super Slab. 1st crux is right off the block.  Use a stick clip if there is any question about making the 1st clip - it's a long way back down to the ground. After 40' of typical Smith moves on tuff, you reach the 2nd crux (no more beta here). Finish on the East set of Super Slab anchors.  You can climb SS to put up a TR.  Good rock as long as you don't go too far left.
