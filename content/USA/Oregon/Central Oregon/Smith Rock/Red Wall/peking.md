# Description
First pitch is classic, many stop at first set of anchors. The upper pitch is great fun though a little loose.

P1 - 5.8 - Hand traverse left to a splitter hand crack. Follow crack up to bolted belay, belay from bolts if planning on just doing first pitch. Or continue up another 60 ft to a good belay ledge blow the P2 crux. Belay from mid sized cams.

P2 - 5.8 - Crank the awkward 5.8 bulge then head striaght up untill your rope runs out. Belay mid sized cams.

4th class scamble to top.
