# Description
An unusual route that starts with easier moves on an aesthetic, highly pocketed wall before hitting a crux sequence about 3/4s up on edges.  The crux feels a bit contrived because the bolting tries to force you into harder terrain when an easier sequence is  a bit off to the side but has a pendulum fall risk as a deterrent.

# Location
Just right of the start of Moscow.

# Protection
Bolts.  Rap Anchors.
