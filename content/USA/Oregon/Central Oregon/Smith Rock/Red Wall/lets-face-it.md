# Description
Great movement on small crisp edges make this an enjoyable route if your comfortable on slightly spicy 10.b

Carefully make your way up to the first bolt (a fall would be ugly) then crimp your way up good edges to an anchor next to the anchor on Peking

# Location
Just left of the crack on pitch one of Peking, two routes over from Moscow.

# Protection
6 bolts
