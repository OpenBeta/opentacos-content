# Description
A fairly short route that climbs on knobs up through a crux bulge near the top.  This route was given 10c in the 92 Watt's guide but feels easier than Dances with Clams to the right.

# Location
On a short pillar just off the Misery Ridge/Red Wall trail, below Bill's Flake.  Just left of the route, Dances with Clams.

# Protection
3 Bolts.  Rap Anchors
