# Description
Given 10a in the 92 Watt's guide, this route has continued to lose some holds since then, and is a bit harder now.  Overall, the rock on the route now feels pretty solid.  Wide edge moves lead to a tricky overhung finish on pockets and edges just before the anchors.

# Location
On a short pillar just off the Misery Ridge/Red Wall trail, below Bill's Flake.  The route on the right side of the pillar.

# Protection
4 bolts, hooks at top to lower off. TR off your own draws.
