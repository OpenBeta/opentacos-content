# Description
This one's got a bit o' everything!

Start out in stepped rock just below Chairman Mao and climb up and into a funky crack system that quickly steepens and leads to some good jams. Follow the crack up through a blunt arete feature then follow it through a dramatic hand traverse left with little or no feet on the slab below. When the crack peters out power straight up the face (pumpy) past a bolt to a ledge with an anchor.

Belay from the top and rap with a 60m or climb and lower with a 70m.

# Location
Between Super Slab and Moscow. starts just right of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book.

# Protection
standard rack with extras from .5 to 1"
