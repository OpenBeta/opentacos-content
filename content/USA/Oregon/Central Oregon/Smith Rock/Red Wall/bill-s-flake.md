# Description
This is a short but fun route located on the far left side of Red Wall.  Look for a large gully that separates Picnic Lunch Wall from Red Wall.  Just right of this gully, there's a ledge system 15-20 feet above ground (accessible near its left side via 4th class "chimney") that runs along the base of the Red Wall.  Bill's Flake follows a circular, 40-foot flake attached to main wall atop the ledge system.

Scramble up to the ledge system (class 4).  Move up a short, left facing dihedral below the flake.  Traverse left on perfect rock via hand jams and underclings (10-).  Move up and follow left side of flake up and right to bolted anchor.
