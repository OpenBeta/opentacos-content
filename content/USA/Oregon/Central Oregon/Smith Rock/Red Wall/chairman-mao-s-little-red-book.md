# Description
This underated climb is a fine outing that can be done as two pitches or as one long pitch with a 60m rope.  The crux comes where you expect on the brilliant 2nd pitch dihedral.

Pitch 1: Begin to the right of Ride the Lightning in a left facing dihedral up to the base of the book.

Pitch 2: Use stemming, palming, fingerstacks to make your way up the perfect corner.  You'll be wishing there was more.

# Location
Rap with two ropes.

# Protection
Nuts and cams to one inch.  Bolted anchor at top.
