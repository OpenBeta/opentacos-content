# Description
Chouinard's Crack is one of the best splitters in the Park.  There's not much more to say about it -expect really fun, straightforward fingers and thin hands crack climbing with solid gear.

If you want to spoil it, finish off with the rest of Peking, but for a great outing, finish up on Moscow.

# Location
Hike across the bridge, and straight up the Misery Ridge trail.  Pass the right side of Picnic Lunch Wall, and most of Red Wall, while hiking uphill.  It screams to you from the trail as you come to the last section of climbing on the Red Wall.

Tell tale signs that you are in the right place are a couple of big blocks to chill on at the base, a chalked up, left leading hand traverse leading to the crack, and the obvious, clean, and inviting crack system to the right (Moscow).

# Protection
Gear from fingers to hands.  If you want to stitch it up, you might be able to wiggle in a blue camalot towards the top, but I bet a no. 2 (hand size) is as big as the crack will allow.
