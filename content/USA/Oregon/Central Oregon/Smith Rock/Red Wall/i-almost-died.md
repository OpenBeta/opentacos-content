# Description
Climb up a steep arching corner crack on good finger jams. The crux for me was a brief section of flaring thin hand with no feet, some intense stemming or back stepping may help. Foot holds start appearing after the undercling, but watch out for animal poops at the jug. Pull the final roof on hand jams to two 1/4" bolt. Walk off.

Warning: Lot's of lose rocks at the top! A baseball sized chunk flew down as far as the stairs as we pulled the rope. Maybe that's how the route was named? Climbers who don't like to wear helmet please stay away.

# Location
Continue walking up the Misery Ridge trail past the Red Wall and you will see an obvious arching roof/corner at the base of Red Ryder Buttress.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5", a BD 3.5 may fit underneath the wide undercling slot.
