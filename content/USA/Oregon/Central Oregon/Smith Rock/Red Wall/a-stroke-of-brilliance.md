# Description
Stroke of Brilliance is incorrectly documented in Alan Watts' Smith Rock Guide, 2nd Ed

This route starts at the 3rd pitch of Super Slab and veers left towards a bolt on the low-angled face. Continue up the slab finding 6 more well spaced bolts along the way and to a crux near the top.

If one follows the current description in the guide they will need cams to 2" and will be climbing a 5.10 crack to reach the slab. The crack is not bolted as described and the first bolt above and to the left of the crack is somewhat useless.

# Location
Climb the first pitch of Super Slab.  Instead of following the buckets that are P2 of Super Slab, scramble and descend left on an easy third class ledge to a dirty landing and start up the unmistakable and attractive overhanging crack.

# Protection
Bolts above the crack.  Gear to 3 inches for the crack.  The guidebook describes the crack as bolted, but it is not.  Protects well with cams.
