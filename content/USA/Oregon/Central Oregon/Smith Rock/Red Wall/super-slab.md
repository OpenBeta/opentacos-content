# Description
This is a fun 5.6 multipitch. The climbing is fantastic and the position is amazing

Pitch 1: 5.6 This climb begins up a left facing dihedral/ramp. Follow the crack occasionally using face holds to a ledge and bolted anchors.  Approximately 35 meters.

Pitch 2: Take a tenuous traverse left. Be careful to protect for the second here. Take this short pitch to a ledge that is almost parallel to the last belay. Natural anchor takes 1-1.5".  Approximately 20 meters.

Pitch 3: Use face features to pull a short steep section and then follow the crack/seam up into another left facing dihedral to the summit.  Approximately 35 meters.

From the top walk back away from the face descending a small slab to a grassy bowl. Then climb up another steep slab for 30ft and then continue hiking west to get to hiking trail. Once at the trail follow it down to the right.
