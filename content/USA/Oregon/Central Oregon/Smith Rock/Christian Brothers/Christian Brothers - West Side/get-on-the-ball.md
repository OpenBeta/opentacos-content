# Description
Not quite up to the task of tackling

Holier Than Thou

? Well, then climb this one. It packs a punch, but the money moves all come before the third bolt. After  you reach the upper half the angle drops and the climbing becomes significantly easier. Enjoy shredding your fingers on those classic sharp nubbins.

This route could be linked with any of the starting routes for

Holier Than Thou

. Or lead from the middle ledge. If you just want to get straight on it, there is a 3rd class scramble up from the left side.

# Location
Just to the right of

Holier Than Thou

, above

Benedictine Punk

/

Manic Nirvana

# Protection
7 bolts
