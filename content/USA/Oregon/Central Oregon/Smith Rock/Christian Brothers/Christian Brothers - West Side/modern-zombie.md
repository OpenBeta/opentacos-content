# Description
Tricky steep face moves and the crux start this route.  Lower angled small knob climbing complete it.  Enjoyable, interesting moves in the first half of the route.

# Location
Inset face in the center of the area.  From Asterisk Pass, just past the Awl and the first routes on the right on a protruding block.

# Protection
Bolts(aprox 6).  Rap anchor.
