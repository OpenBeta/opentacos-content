# Description
This route looks awesome and climbs ok. Start with an innocent slab that meets up with a pretty mean looking roof crack. Surprisingly, the climbing across the roof isn't that bad. The crux comes at the lip to get on top of it, after which you will continue up ten or so feet and slightly left to the anchors. Getting good protection for the roof is possible with some small cams and a little creativity.

# Location
Look for the vary obvious roof crack to the right of Benedictine Punk and the other sport routes.

# Protection
Pro to 1.5". Have a couple small TCU's or the like. anchors to the left of the crack just above the roof. Same as Manic Nirvana.
