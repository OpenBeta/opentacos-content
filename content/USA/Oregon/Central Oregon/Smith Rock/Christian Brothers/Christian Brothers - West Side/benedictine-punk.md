# Description
Scramble to the ledge just below the obvious (short) crack.  Clip the first bolt and climb through the crux past the end of the crack to easier nubbin climbing to the anchors.

# Location
Left of Manic Nirvana & Midriff Bulge

# Protection
10 bolts. First anchors for top-rope or rap. Higher anchors if belaying for upper pitches.
