# Description
A surprisingly difficult flared crack leads you up 20 feet to a solid ledge where you can recover and wipe away the tears of near defeat.  Follow a few more bolts another 40 feet up a 5.5 face to the goose poop covered summit.

Rappel down the overhanging east side back to the trail.

Watts gives this a 3 star rating.  I can see that based on history alone.  However, I had two very nice face holds break off on me.  the 5.5 face is a bit crumbly too.  Rock quality of the crack is top notch though, even if the crack shape is tough to jam.

If you like obscure historical routes, be sure to add the summit of the Awl to your sick, twisted bucket list.

# Location
Located on the obvious dihedral on the Awl, just over Asterisk Pass.

# Protection
Nuts/ Cams to .75", 6 or 7 bolts.

We used 4 nuts, ranging from .4" to .7"
