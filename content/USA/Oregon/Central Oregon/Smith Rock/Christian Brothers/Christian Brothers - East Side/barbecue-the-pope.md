# Description
A popular and well-known route at Smith, Barbecue The Pope is basically an old-style Smith nubbin and crimp climb.  The first bolt is a ways up and the second bolt is a little far left for how the route now gets climbed.  Both have seen their share of falls.  After the second bolt, veer right around the small overhang, then back left and up on endless tricky nubbins and edges.  A couple crux sections hit you before you reach the final tricky spot moving past the slot at the top of New Testament crack.

# Location
On the right side of Testament Slab, just left of a shallow dihedral(Golgotha) and right of a wide crack(New Testament).

# Protection
Bolts (7).  Bolt Anchors
