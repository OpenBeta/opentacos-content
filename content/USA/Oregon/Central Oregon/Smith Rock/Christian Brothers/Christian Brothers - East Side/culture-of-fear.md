# Description
The Culture of Fear extends off the anchors of Panic Attack. Unlike the lower section, this route earns its name by forcing climbers to do 5.12 arete climbing with good whipper potential. After Panic Attack, start up onto some face climbing which leads to the insecure dihedral. Exiting the dihedral is the technical crux on very small holds. Once on the arete, begin the powerful crux while your feet pass the bolt below! Passing the last bolt has one last thuggy move that leads to a ledge where you clip the anchor out left.

# Location
Extension off panic attack located in the Christian Brothers area

# Protection
Pre hung from the top of Panic Attack, which is 7 bolt plus one for the anchor. (Bring a long sling for the anchor if you don't want to clip the end of the chain of panic attack)
