# Description
Although it sees fewer ascents than

Rude Boys

with which it shares the crux and first 3 bolts, the rock is every bit as good.  The 5.11 slab that constitutes the bulk of the climbing is nothing to sneeze at after the twin 5.13 cruxes at the start.

# Location
Shares the start with

Rude Boys

then heads up left after the 3rd bolt.

# Protection
