# Description
Mark was a pivotal climber in the 1980's and was a fantastic partner and avid mountaineer all around the Northwest.  On June 14th 2012 he took a long and unroped fall during a solo ascent of Mt. Hood.

This intriguing addition to the Christian Brother's sport climbs is a memorial to Mark.  You'll find that it is a little bit safer than BBQ the Pope, especially at the bottom where it has 3 bolts to BBQ's 2.  Expect intellectual climbing for the first half and a line that slowly merges towards BBQ towards the end.  Following an independent line at the very top is probably harder than traversing into the more chalked BBQ finish.

# Location
In between Testament Crack to the left and BBQ the Pope to the right.  The line has black Metolius Hangers on it.  There is now a shared anchor for the MCM route and Testament Crack that is separate from the BBQ the Pope Anchors

# Protection
This route starts with 6 Metolius hangers and finishes slightly right on the last 2 glue-in bolts on BBQ The Pope, leading to an anchor with fixed biners, so bring 8 draws
