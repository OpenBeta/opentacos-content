# Description
Start on a large ledge and head up on horizontal pockets leading to a thin face crux.  Finish with a committing layback move around a bulge (mental crux?) and then on to the anchors on easy knobs.  This route is not in the 1992 Watts guide.

# Location
Just left of the Testament Slab and just past the Gothic Cathedral gully.

# Protection
Bolts.  Rap anchors up top.
