# Description
Very fun, new addition to the Christian Brother's area. It has a moderate start, and a v8/9 crimpy crux from bolt 4-5. after that, there is a small runout on 5.10 terrain. After a no hands rest, there is a tricky slab section, followed by a powerful compression section.

# Location
Starts just to the left of panic attack, shares an anchor with Culture of Fear. 60m rope should be enough to get down.

# Protection
Quickdraws
