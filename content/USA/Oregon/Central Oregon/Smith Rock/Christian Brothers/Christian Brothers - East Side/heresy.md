# Description
A new classic!!! Heresy starts on a flake just left of the

Shoes of the Fisherman

.  Move up and heelhook your way left on huge huecos.  Some stick clip first bolt.  Move up steep powerful moves on good edges.  The crux comes just before the anchors.  There are several ways to finish this pumpy climb but any way that you finish you'll have a crowd clapping when your done.
