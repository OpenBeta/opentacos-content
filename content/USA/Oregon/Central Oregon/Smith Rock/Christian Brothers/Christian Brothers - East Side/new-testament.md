# Description
This right leaning crack has some awkward moves as it angles it's way up to the crux at the top finishing slot.  Probably not a good route for someone just getting into leading 10a trad.  Back in the 90's, a shaky climber fell at the crux, and ripped out enough of his gear to ground.  Amazingly, he lived through it.

# Location
Just left of

Barbecue The Pope

and just right of the arete.

# Protection
Gear to 3". Rap anchors.  Note: Rock quality is fine but gear may not hold as well due to a lot of surface irregularities inside the crack.
