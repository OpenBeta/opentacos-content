# Description
A potentially hair-raising 6 inch crack that is formed by the right side of the Combination Blocks leaning against the wall.

If my memory serves me, Watts says, 'Boldly layback the start'.  Without 6 inch cams or big bros, this would be Bold indeed.  I only had one 6 inch cam with me, and it was not easy to place in the crack that turned out to be mostly a little bigger than 6 inches.  The crux is at about thirty feet, just before you pull over the lip halfway, so if you only have one, bring that baby with you to protect the crux.  I ended up soloing that section, laybacking and smearing on birdshit, with my 6 inch cam 15 feet below me.  The upper squeeze section is fun, clean, and a different flavor than most of Smith.

If you have the big cams, and know how to use them, this is a cool route.

# Location
Right side of Combination Blocks.

# Protection
Hand sized to 6 inch cams.
