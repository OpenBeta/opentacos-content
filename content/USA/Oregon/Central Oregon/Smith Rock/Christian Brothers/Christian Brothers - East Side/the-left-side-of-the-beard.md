# Description
This line is lower in grade but more fun than it's cousin to the right. Get up into the corner and then start traversing to the right up a ramp with a wide crack to follow. the upper crack takes larger cams but it's so short, it doesn't need more than two pieces to reach the anchors.

# Location
Start at The corner system directly right of Barbecue the Pope and climb up ten or so feet until you see the horizontal crack going right. Follow that to anchors.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches. Sling your first piece or two. There is an old cam stuck in the upper crack. Do not use it for protection. It moves with ease.
