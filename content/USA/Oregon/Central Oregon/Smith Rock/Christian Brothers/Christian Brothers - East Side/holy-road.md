# Description
From the Via Dolorosa anchors, crank on a jug to clip the first bolt, and you're off. Most of the climbing is on the right side of the arete, but you might like what you find around the corner. The crux is toward the top, but there are several tricky sections depending on how you use the arete. Move out right onto the face to clip the chains. You can lower to the top of Testament Slab with a 70M rope.

# Location
Steep arete above Via Dolorosa and the Testament Slab. Start with any of the base area routes (recommended start is Nightingale's on Vacation) and continue to the highest set of anchors on the slab.

# Protection
Draws: 12-14 if linking with Via Dolorosa.

Optional: 1 blue, 1 yellow TCU

Brand new chain anchors.
