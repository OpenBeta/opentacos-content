# Description
This classic route shares the first bolt with Dreamin' before traversing left and merging with Rude Boys just before the sparsely protected slab.

The technical crux comes immediately after the second bolt and a powerful lockoff gains the slab above the fourth bolt. Sustained face climbing on welded tuff past two more bolts and a fixed stopper leads to the anchor.

The 12b rating seemed somewhat soft relative to other 12b's I have climbed at Smith.

# Location
Prophet Wall

# Protection
Quick Draws for six bolts and a fixed stopper.
