# Description
This route got all cleaned, bolted and figure out by both Sam Hanslits and Alan Collins. After all the prep got done, the FA got passed on to John Collins for a fathers day gift.

Start off on a powerful start leaving the ledge passing the first bolt. If the right sequence is found, it seems 5.10, but it is easy to use powerful beta here. Climb to the 3rd bolt before the the climbing begins to get hard again. From the 3rd bolt, expect sustained climbing for the grade till the last bolt is clipped. Getting to the last bolt, you can either go left (more technical) or right (more powerful but less technical). I though going left seems more locker and probably easier, but I bolted it so you can go either way.

Enjoy!!
