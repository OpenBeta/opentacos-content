# Description
Toys in the attic follows a nice crack in a deep recess/chimney (capped by a roof) on the west side of The Christian Brothers formation.  Start up easy (guano filled) crack on left side of chimney (5.6 at bottom).  Going gradually steepens but the rock and crack quality steadily improve.  Crack turns into an OW (#4-#4.5 Camalot useful) near the ceiling.  At the ceiling, traverse DOWN and left following a finger crack (crux?) for about 20 feet to bolt anchor.  Note that the route is scarier to follow than to lead.
