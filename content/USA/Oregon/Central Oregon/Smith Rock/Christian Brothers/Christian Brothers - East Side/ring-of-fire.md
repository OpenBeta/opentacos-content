# Description
Ring of Fire climbs up just left of center of the face immediately to the left of the Combination Blocks. The very well-protected crux comes about 1/3rd of the way up at a small overhanging section, which is then followed by consistent 5.10+ climbing to the anchors.

If you study the holds from the ground this is a great opportunity for a 5.11+ onsight.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
6 bolts and a bolted anchor
