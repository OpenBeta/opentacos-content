# Description
Toy Blocks climbs the obvious traversing hand crack that starts immediately left of Ring Of Fire.  Move up to the crack (can clip a bolt on the new bolted 10b) and follow it rightward.  After about 15 feet of diagonal traversing, move up via a thin hand crack.  Climb up this intermittent crack system alternating between face moves and cracks in the acute dihedral (crux).  Watch for a bit of hollow-sounding rock here & a small, movable block near the top.  Move left at top to bolted anchor.

# Location
Combination Blocks area on east side of Christian Brothers formation.

# Protection
Double set of cams to #2 Camalot.  Additional finger sized pieces might be useful.
