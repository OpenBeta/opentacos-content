# Description
Sustained climbing leads to a surprisingly balancy crux right before reaching the arete.  Don't get run off by the slightly high second bolt as the holds are bomber till after the clip.

# Location
This line runs directly up the middle of combination blocks, 10ft right of Double Trouble

# Protection
bolts
