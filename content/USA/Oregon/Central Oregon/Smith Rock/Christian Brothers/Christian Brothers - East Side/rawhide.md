# Description
The first ten feet of rawhide is overhanging and strenuous as you pull through a sea of pockets and edges.  A variety of sequences will get you to the first bolt.  Consider stick clipping the first bolt if you have any doubt about the bouldery start.

After the first bolt the climbing eases as you traverse leftward on horizontal edges.  The crux comes at the third bolt where you are forced to use some greasy small holds.  A long crank establishes you on a good jug and moderate climbing takes you to the anchors.

This is not a good route to do in the sun.  The holds can get very greasy.

Down cleaning is hard due to the traversing nature of the climb.  It is easiest to get a friend to follow and clean the route.

# Location
Follow man made rock steps up passed Smooth Boy to the start of the climb.

# Protection
4 bolts plus anchors
