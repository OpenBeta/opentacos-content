# Description
This is a short pitch that starts from the top of the Testament Slab and follows a seam through a bulge just left of Heathen's Highway.

The route is short as has some questionable rock, as a separate route I cannot recommend it, as an extension to Nightengales or Irreverance however it is worth doing.

# Location
Above the Testament Slab. Start with Revelations, Irreverance or Nightengales on Vacation and belay as high as possible or link it.

# Protection
bolts
