# Description
With crucial help from Alan Collins and Chris Hatzai (thanks!!), Sam Hanslits cleaned, bolted, and got the FA of Lightsaber after Return of the Redeye was put up.

Exit the big ledge left before stepping back right onto the face. Large holds fade into Smith nubbins (crux). The slab lasts until the 7th bolt. From here, power straight up on positive holds until you reach the large rough gray mass that can be gripped many ways, and then find decent holds to traverse right in order to get to the anchor.

This route shares the same start and finish as Return of the Red Eye and could easily be climbed to setup a toprope on Return of the Red Eye. This route has some rope drag

# Location
Above Jete (5.8), Dancer (5.7), and Earth Boys (5.10b). All these climbs lead to the belay

# Protection
8 lead bolts and anchors
