# Description
Great beginning moves on nubbins and knobs, transferring to some sidepulls and and balancy crimping. Crux comes just below the anchors if you are going for the anchors shared with Ring of Fire, crux is just after the 2nd bolt if you go up left of the arete by Dancer. This route lies just right of Jete and Dancer, just left of Ring of Fire. Fun route. Be wary, there was a rattlesnake in the large crack on the left hand side of the route when I climbed it today. It should be noted that a letter grade is added if you go for the Ring of Fire anchors.

# Location
Left of the combination blocks n the Western end of the Christian Brothers.

# Protection
7 bolts
