# Description
Double Trouble is the most popular route on the Combination blocks for good reason.  The sharp arete up the magically stacked blocks begs to be climbed.

Begin on the face and climb up using face and arete holds.  A ledge provides a rest midway up but moving back onto the route can prove difficult for some.
