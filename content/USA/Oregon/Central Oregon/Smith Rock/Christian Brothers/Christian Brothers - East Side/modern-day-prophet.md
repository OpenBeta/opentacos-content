# Description
New direct start to Boy Prophet. Makes for a truer line and adds a fun boulder at the start. Bolted by Will Nazarian, don't think it had been climbed yet. Worth doing!

# Location
In between Rude Boys and Dreamin'. 2 or 3 new bolts lead directly up to the big rail where it links in with Rude Boys.

# Protection
Bolts. You will likely need a few quickdraws for the start, Rude Boys is usually fixed.
