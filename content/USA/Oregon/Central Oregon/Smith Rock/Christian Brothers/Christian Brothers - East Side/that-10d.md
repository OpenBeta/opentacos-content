# Description
Another great  sandbagged 12- at smith! This one feels like one of the harder 12-'s in the park, but its all subjective. Climbing past the first bolt is intimating, but the right sequence feels secure. After the 3rd bolt, the climbing eases up until a bouldery crux establishing under the roof. Although their is not much signs of traffic on this route, its is well worth doing. Rock is good and has some unique movement
