# Description
Unfortunately I've only belayed this route, but not a lot of people know about it so I thought it would be wise to post it here to encourage traffic.  El Sancho starts with a pretty difficult sequence off the ground to a quick shake but the difficulties continue towards the top (around 12b from the first good holds)

# Location
This route is on the Blasphemy/Panic Attack Ledge and is the route with the black Metolius Hangers.

# Protection
Bolts
