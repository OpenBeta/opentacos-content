# Description
Deep Splash starts out with some physical bouldering and tenuous shakes before a crux above the second bolt on very small crimps.  The difficulty eases above but not by much.  Unfortunately the climb trends into a bad patch of rock where a good rest can be found, but then the upper headwall makes up for it.
