# Description
This route has one hard section in the middle of the route.  The crux is a tricky sequence in a slight bulge just above a ledge, and a fall at this spot may land you on the ledge.  Enjoyable moves here, but oh so short, then on to an easy finish.

# Location
On the far left side of the Testament Slab, right of the chimney/gully, Gothic Cathedral, and  just right of the crack line, Old Testament.

# Protection
Bolts.  Rap Anchors.
