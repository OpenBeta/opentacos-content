# Description
Revelations was the first fully bolted sport route at Smith, which makes it historic.  Unfortunately age isn't everything, and this climb is like old creaky Uncle Sid.  He shows up at the family reunions, he's a nice guy, you try to like him...but he's just a little bit too weird in the end.

Revelations climbs the bolted arete left of Barbecue the Pope.  Pinch and tiptoe your way up the pebbley face, using the arete as you go.  I found this climb to be a little insecure with some odd sequences between bolts-- and there's a lot of between bolts on this one.  There's probably no more run out than on most other Smith routes, but these pebbley slabs do something to my head.
