# Description
This route is more of a novelty than a fun climb. Start on the back of the snoopy looking head. Climb up bad rock to the top. I had rock break like chalk in my hand. when you get to the top, the real fun begins. Down climb back to the base via the same way up. Be very careful getting back down as this is the crux and the rock is easily broken.

# Location
The obvious snoopy looking boulder sitting atop the Asterisk pass.

# Protection
Free Solo
