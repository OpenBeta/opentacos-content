# Description
Fun, airy route that climbs the arete on the southern edge of The Priest.  The crux is a well protected step from a ledge not quite half way up that has minimal footholds. Then romp up and to the right to the anchors and great views of the Cascade Mountains to the west and the Crooked River to the east.

# Location
Up hill towards Asterisk Pass from Dancer / Jete. Requires a short scramble from the trail to reach the base of the climb.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Two bolt anchor (shared with That First Step).  Can be climbed with a 50 meter rope with a rap to the start of That First Step and then a downclimb from the First Step block.  To rap all the way back to the start of Catherine it requires a 60 meter rope.
