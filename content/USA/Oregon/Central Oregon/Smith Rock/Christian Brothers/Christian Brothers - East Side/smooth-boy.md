# Description
This line provides a nice alternative to the other hard lines on this wall, as it lacks a tedious slab section. Begin on the two best holds on the route and the business begins. Funk your way through a series of slopers and side pulls for the first four bolts (roughly 12b). Then enter the desperate roof sequence. Small shallow pockets couple with a well placed knee scum allow you to gain a small side pull just above the roof (13ish). Extremely delicate half pad crimps for the next two bolts keeps you in doubt till you clip the anchor.

# Location
Just to the left of the traversing route "rawhide" near the top of the Prophet wall.

# Protection
bolts
