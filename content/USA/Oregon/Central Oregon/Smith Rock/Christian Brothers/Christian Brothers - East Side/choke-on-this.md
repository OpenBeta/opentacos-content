# Description
Begin with several easy moves on good pockets and edges, then tackle an especially tricky sequence between the third and fourth bolts. From here climb through two tiered panels, each easier than the last, to the anchors.

This route sees few ascents as its exceedingly technical nature (even for Smith) keeps most away. Expect as much of a mental challenge as a physical one.

# Location
Just uphill of Dreamin and below Smooth Boy

# Protection
7 Bolts
