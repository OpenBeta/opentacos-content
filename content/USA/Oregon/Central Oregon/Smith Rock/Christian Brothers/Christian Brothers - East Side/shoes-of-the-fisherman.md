# Description
Although SOTF gets the same grade as Wartley's Revenge, its neighbor to the left, the climbing is much more physically demanding.

Initially, the overhanging crack can be jammed with hands / fists but after deciphering the bulging crux the crack tapers to thin hands / fingers and remains demanding until close to the anchor.

If the pigeon guano down low and loose rock just underneath the anchor was absent this would be a 3 star route.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Stoppers and cams to 3" provide solid protection. Take doubles of .75" - 2" cams. Bolted rappel anchor at the top of the first pitch.
