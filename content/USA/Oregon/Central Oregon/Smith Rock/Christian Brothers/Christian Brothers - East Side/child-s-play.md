# Description
This is a great variation to Toys in the Attic.  Start up the poop filled crack of Toys, and at about 45 feet up you will see a thin crack rise diagonally up and left.  This crack is tips to fingers, and climbs delicately with occasional good feet.  Finishes on the Hesitation Blues Anchor.

# Location
Combination blocks area, in the far corner of the alcove.

# Protection
standard rack, tips and fingers gear for the crux.
