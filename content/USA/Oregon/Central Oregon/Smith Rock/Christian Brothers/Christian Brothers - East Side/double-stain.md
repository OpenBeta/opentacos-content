# Description
Smith Rock's first 5.13 ascends a forgotten pin-scarred crack on an overhanging wall (for Smith standards). Despite good rock and a great position, Double Stain receives little attention. Gear placement played a big role in the FA, though most climbers these days pre-place every micro-nut. The crux finesses tip-jamming pin scars at the start, leading to a good stop in the middle.

# Location
This route lies just right of Bum Rush the Show just above the combination blocks. Approach any Combination Blocks' routes

# Protection
Mixed to 1" - micro nuts
