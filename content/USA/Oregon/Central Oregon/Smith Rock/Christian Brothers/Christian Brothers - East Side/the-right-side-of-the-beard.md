# Description
This route follows the perfectly protected crack running up the right side of the beard block (hence the name). It is fairly straight forward and has no defined crux. Don't expect to have great feet throughout this short line.

# Location
This route is on the right side of the block directly left of Barbecue The Pope.

# Protection
Gear to 2 inches. No need for slings as this crack runs pretty straight. Anchors shared with The Left side of the Beard.
