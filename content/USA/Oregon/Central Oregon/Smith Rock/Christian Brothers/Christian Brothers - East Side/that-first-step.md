# Description
From atop the exposed block clip the first bolt, check your pulse, step across the void and start climbing.

# Location
Uphill from Dancer / Jete on the face next to the southern edge of The Priest.  A short scramble from the trail and an easy move puts you on top of the block and at the start of the route.  The first bolt is easily clipped standing on the block.

# Protection
Quickdraws.  Two bolt anchor (shared with Catherine Finds An Edge). Can be climbed with a 50 meter rope but rap carefully!
