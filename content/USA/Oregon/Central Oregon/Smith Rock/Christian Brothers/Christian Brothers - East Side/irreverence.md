# Description
This route now goes straight up past a hand crack on the left to chain anchors. Fairly sustained for the first half, with the crux being on tricky pocket and knob moves after the 3rd bolt.

# Location
Just left of the Revelations arete in the middle of  the wall.

# Protection
Bolts (aprox. 6).   Rap Anchors.
