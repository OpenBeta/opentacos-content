# Description
Big bone lick starts in an obtuse, left leaning diherdral, manteling up a few mini ledges to a cool undercling knob, and then ascends the slightly overhung jug haul. Let it be known that it has a bunch of drilled pockets....unfortunate

# Location
On climbers right of the east face of the prophet wall in a big left leaning diherdral.

# Protection
Lots of draws and maybe one extendable
