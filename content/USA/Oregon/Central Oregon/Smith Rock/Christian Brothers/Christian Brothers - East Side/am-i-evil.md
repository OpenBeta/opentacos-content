# Description
The crux is the start up a crack.  Layback the crack to where it traverses left, place a piece of protection (recommended: PG-13), and continue to the first bolt.  Follow the crack clipping bolts until you reach the anchors for Little Indian Princess.  Can be top roped by climbing Little Indian Princess.

# Location
Climb to and past the start to Catherine Finds An Edge through a narrow notch located at the western-most edge of The Priest. Scramble down into a small alcove to the starts for Little Indian Princess, Am I Evil? and Lunatic to Love. Am I Evil? is the center route.

# Protection
Quickdraws but a medium piece of trad pro is very useful to protect the final moves to the first bolt.
