# Description
This mixed line begins with excellent thin crack climbing up a left-leaning open book, culminating in a sinister face-climbing crux past two ancient & well spaced bolts, before joining the anchor atop Barbecue the Pope.  The crack provides its own warm-up, starting with 5.8-ish stemming, and getting progressively harder before peetering out altogether.  A good stemming rest below the crux provides an opportunity to scope out the difficulties--awkward moves up a shallow arete with rounded feet.  A long reach is helpful here, but small intermediates provide options for climbers of all sizes.  Once you reach the large horizontal pocket, traverse left and finish up relatively easy crimps.

"Golgotha" is the name of the hill where Christ was crucified.

# Location
Climbs the obvious open-book immediately right of Barbecue the Pope on the Testament Slab.  Begins up "The Left Side of the Beard", before branching out left.

# Protection
Gear to 1", mostly blue & yellow TCU's.  The crack eats up nuts if you're so inclined.  2 Bolts & a 2 bolt anchor.  The Watts guide gives this an "R" rating.  The gear in the crack is bomber & plentiful, but the bolts at the top are fairly spaced, and they look pretty old.
