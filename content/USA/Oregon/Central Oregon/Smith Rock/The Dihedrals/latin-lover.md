# Description
Another steep, sporty, and balancy Dihedrals climb.  While it may not be the classic that

Heinous Cling

is, it's definately worth doing.  A tricky thin traversing crux comes near the top by the last bolt.

Latin Lover is in the box-shaped enclave on the right end of the Dihedrals, and is on the face directly opposite from To Bolt or Not to Be.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
6 bolts with a bolted anchor
