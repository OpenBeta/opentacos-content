# Description
Most climbers start this classic arete route by veering in from the right onto the arete rather than the original direct start.  Continuous technical arete moves highlight the climb.  For myself, I've found the moves past the final bolt easiest on the left (the original crux), while the majority of climbers apparently find it easier to stay on the right side.

# Location
The arete just left of Karate Crack, in front of the stair-steps.

# Protection
5 Bolts.
