# Description
Start using the arete and a series of crimps to clip the first bolt. Traverse left and finesse your way up a sea of edges and crimps until you get to a flat ledge. Mantle on the ledge and stem up the technical corner to easier terrain. Awesome athletic route.

# Location
First line to the right of wedding day.

# Protection
bolts
