# Description
Do this in one pitch....

Climb Ginger snap to the shared anchor with Cinnamon Slab and keep going up. Veer left following a line of bolts up the arete to the top of the formation. Don't get sucked left to the chains above Karate Wall, continue straight above the last bolt and top out. Use longs slings on the last bolt of G. Snap, the anchor and the next couple bolts to avoid drag.

Super fun.

The anchors are set back from the lip and have no rap rings. You'll need to belay everyone to the top and then rappel Cinnamon Slab (rings to the right) or use some other rappel station.
