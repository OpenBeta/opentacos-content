# Description
This radically neglected face climb was one of the less-famous results of the French Invasion of 1986.  Despite perfect rock, interesting moves, & an accessible grade, this route sits totally ignored at the busiest crag at Smith, likely due to the R-rating in the Watts guide.  However, it has been recently rebolted, and the R rating is no longer valid.

The route ascends the pretty pink face in the back of the alcove between Watts Totts & To Bolt.  Begin by scrambling up ledges immediately left of Latin Lover.  There is a bit of lose gravel on these ledges, so use caution.  A thin-hand sized piece can be used to protect these moves, but is not necessary.  From the ledge head straight up the face on cool knobs & the occasional shallow pocket.  Use care approaching the second bolt.  The crux comes below the 4th bolt, on a tenuous traverse from left to right.

Almost Nothing gets a lot of shade compared to other Dihedrals routes, making it a good morning option on a warm day.

# Location
In the alcove, immediately right of Take a Powder, and left of the thin off-set seam of Lester Tots.

# Protection
7 bolts(?), 2 BA.  The route is really not runout at all by Smith standards, and with the re-bolting is no longer R rated.
