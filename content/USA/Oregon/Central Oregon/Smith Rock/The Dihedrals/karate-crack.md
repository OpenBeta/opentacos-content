# Description
This is the "fishhook" shaped crack you see as you're hiking towards The Dihedrals area. It is on the vertical wall immediately left of a low angle narrow ramp (ramp is the 1st pitch of Cinamon Slab route, 5.6).

The route has some short, not terribly thought-provoking, though kind of strenuous climbing. And it is great fun! Jam the crack which fluctuates from #3 to #1 Camalot size (hands to thin hands). There are some face holds to take advantage of as well if you prefer. At the top, the crack turns right and traverses for about 6 feet. Step right into a deep chimney and climb up 6 feet to a bolted anchor on the right wall of the chimney.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Cams from #0.75 to #3 Camalot (doubles from #1 to #3).  A #0.5 Camalot (or red Alien) works well in protecting the downclimb inside chimney.
