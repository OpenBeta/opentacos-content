# Description
Lycopodophyta climbs a right facing dihedral just right of Helium Woman.  This climb is a pleasant way to top out at Smith, and a good lead for a new trad leader.

Climb the corner using perfect hand and fist jams, plus numerous features on the faces for feet and hands.  There is one short section of finger crack 2/3 of the way up where the gear thins, but it is easily passed in one or two moves and you don't have to finger jam to climb past.  At the top of the crack, step right and belay from the anchors above the first pitch of Bunny Face.

From the anchors on Bunny Face, you could rap to the ground.  Or top out by stepping down and right (slightly spooky, place a piece before you reach the bolts) and following the bolts on Bunny Face to the top (5.6).

Another option (the original second pitch) would be to continue up the crack through a wide, grungy and flaring section to the top (5.8).

# Location
To descend we did two raps off Cinnamon Slab.  There is likely a better way.

# Protection
Gear to 2" for the first pitch.
