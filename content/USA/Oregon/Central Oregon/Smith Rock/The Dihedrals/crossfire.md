# Description
Crossfire is a striking line that requires a variety of climbing skills from handjams to tiny crimp cruxes and hellacious endurance.  Slightly overhanging the entire way, the climbing is spectacular.  Fantastic jams down low on

Karate Crack

lead to classic Smith face climbing up higher on nubins, pockets, and crimps.  Several semi-rests make the marathon pitch seem plausible but still pumpy and interesting.

The route begins up Karate crack.  As

Karate Crack

arches right, leave the crack and continue straight up the face.  After placing a large cam in a pod above the crack you'll enter the sport part of the climb.  This climb is commonly said to have two cruxes.  One down low is reachy, thin, and crimpy but short while up higher you'll go through a sequential endurance sequence.  There are several runout sections especially up high as you traverse to the left to finish.  Mercifully the climbing is easier and the wall is steep but more than one climber has experienced an exhilarating fall there.

After topping out you can be lowered with a 70m or use the nearby Cinnamon slab to make two raps down.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
You'll need a 70m rope do be lowered off or do some easy downclimbing with a 60m.

One set of cams to a #3 camalot should get you through the

Karate Crack

section with an optional #4 camalot to place in a large pocket just above the crack.  After leaving the large pocket you'll need 10-12 quickdraws to get you to the chains up top.  Some people elect to use long runners on a few bolts up higher to minimize rope drag.  Use of a light rope is also beneficial on this climb.
