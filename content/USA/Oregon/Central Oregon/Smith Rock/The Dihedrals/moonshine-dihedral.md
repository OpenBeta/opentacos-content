# Description
This is one of the most classic trad lines at Smith.  The crux is in the first 20ft but many a climber has been shut down up high going for the chains.  It protects well at any point and has classic stemming and finger locks.  Climb the corner to anchors on the face.

There is a decent second pitch but most make it a one pitch endeavor.
