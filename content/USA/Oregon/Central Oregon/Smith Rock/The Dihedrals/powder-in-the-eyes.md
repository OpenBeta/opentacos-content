# Description
This notorious sandbag is perhaps the most neglected sport route in the Dihedrals (other contenders: Peepshow, Almost Nothing?).  Given 5.12c in the Watts Guide, this line is a big step up in difficulty from Full Heinous or Last Waltz.  Many a hard man has been spanked by the deceptive, continuous, funkery lurking innocently left of Take a Powder.

However, if you can get past the grade issue, this line offers a full (half) rope-length of stellar movement on Smith's top-shelf stone.

Begin with the first 3 bolts of Take a Powder.  Veer left along the obvious undercling flake, and tackle the subtle arete feature.  The first crux hits just above the 4th bolt, then a good clipping stance at the 5th, then the next crux, slapping the left hand up the arete with tricky feet and a difficult 2-finger pocket move.  Above the climbing eases slightly, but remains quite technical.

This route can feel pretty sharp if you pick a warm day.  There seems to be two ways to consider the grade:  5.12 moves with 5.13 beta, or 5.13 moves with 5.12 beta.  In any case, this one won't be down-rated from 12c any time soon!
