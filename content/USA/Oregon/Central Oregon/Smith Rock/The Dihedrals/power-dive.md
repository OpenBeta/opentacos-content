The route begins up Karate crack. As Karate Crack arches right, leave the crack and continue straight up the face.

From the pod clip the first bolt and continue up the face.  Technical moves with decent/good rests.

# Location

# Protection
Gear to 3" for Karate Crack + a large cam for the pod above.  Bolts from there.
