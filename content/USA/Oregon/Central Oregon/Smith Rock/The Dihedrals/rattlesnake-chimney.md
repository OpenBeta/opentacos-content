# Description
Big, dirty chimney.  Nice hidey hole for your belayer to duck into to get out of rockfall danger.  Bring your adventure hat.

# Location
Huge chimney just south of Chain Reaction in The Dihedrals.

# Protection
Big gear. Couple bomber placements in the larger hex size as well as great 1-4 BD cams, though you might be wishing you'd brought bigger.  Single bolted belay which you can skip and head straight for the top with a 60 meter rope.
