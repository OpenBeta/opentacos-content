# Description
This new link-up combines the hard climbing on Powder in the Eyes with a much harder start, via Little Miss Sunshine, and a traverse crux linking between the two. Climb the first four bolts of Little Miss Sunshine past multiple long lock-offs on small crimps, then angle right past a new bolt, over to a good flat edge on the face just left of the Powder in the Eyes arete. With no real rest, launch into the first crux of Powder in the Eyes, and climb that route to the top. Get ready to crimp hard, starting right off the ground!

# Location
See that chalkless, seemingly holdless wall to the left of the Take a Powder flake? That's you! Looks fun, right?

# Protection
9 bolts
