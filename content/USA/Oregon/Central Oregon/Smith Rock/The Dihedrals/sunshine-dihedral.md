# Description
Technical stemming up an ominous dihedral combined with a few powerful moves over bulging sections is encountered on this classic test piece. Although the crux (11+) is at a steep bulge about 10' above a 1/4" bolt and 80' off the deck, difficult moves occur right off the ground and continue to the anchors at the top of Pitch #1.

# Location
This obvious line in the dihedrals is just right of To Bolt Or Not To Be and left of Powder in the Eyes.

# Protection
Multiple stoppers, RP's, HB offsets, and small cams (I didn't use anything larger than an orange TCU). There are also two old bolts (1/4" and 5/16") and a piton that will probably still arrest a fall. Anchors are at the top of Pitch #1.
