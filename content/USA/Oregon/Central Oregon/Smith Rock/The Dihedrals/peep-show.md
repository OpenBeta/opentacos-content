# Description
The ultimate slab climb? Lurking above Latin Lover is a barely visible line of bolts stretching into an infinity of chalkless nubbins, edges, and pockets.  This is Peepshow.  While it's not necessarily the type of route you'll come back to do again and again, it is a route you should tick at least once in your life.

If Latin Lover goes well for you, then Peepshow should make for quick work.  Start up Latin Lover and at the 5th bolt, instead of traversing right to the anchor, continue straight up, wandering back and forth over the bolt line via unending balancy, edgy climbing.  I found the crux to be somewhere in the middle of the extension, but the real challenge will almost certainly be keeping it all together to the chains.  All in all a fantastic route that should really get more traffic.

A note on getting down: lowering off the top, my 70m just barely got me to the Latin Lover anchor where I had to clip in and pull/rethread.  This is a long pitch so tie knots in your ends and pay attention!

# Location
Directly above Latin Lover and across from To Bolt, Take A Powder, etc...

# Protection
16 draws plus whatever for the anchors.  This route could use some chain at the anchors.  The current configuration puts mega twists in your rope.
