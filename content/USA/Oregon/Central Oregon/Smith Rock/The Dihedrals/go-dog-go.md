# Description
The most notable feature of Go Dog Go is the overhanging finish, but you'll have to engage in some typical Smith face climbing to access the higher classic moves.

Begin by soloing up a chossy mess to the first bolt. Next negotiate a tenuous rightward traverse. From the third bolt to the seventh bolt expect slippery face climbing with two cruxy sections. At the overhanging finish, carefully set up on two shallow two finger pockets and get psyched to throw to a jug. The finish is physical and juggy so move quickly and clip the chains before you pump out. This route has one of the most breath taking positions in the entire park.

# Location
The eye catching overhanging face on the far left side of the dihedrals.  Shares the first three bolts with Vision.
