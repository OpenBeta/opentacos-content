# Description
This epic linkup has to be one of the best climbs in the Dihedrals. Climb Latest Rage almost to the chains, then make an easy but runout hand traverse right to the fourth bolt on Karate Wall into that route's crux, then quest to the top of the wall. A no-hands rest at the top of Latest Rage makes this similar in difficulty to Karate Wall but with arguably better climbing.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Bolts.

Also note, you cannot lower to the ground with a 70m (80m works) but with some shenanigans you can pull the rope and move your belayer up to the base of Karate Wall and lower all the way with 70.
