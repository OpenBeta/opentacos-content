# Description
A great arete route despite bad rock to start. Climb 20 feet of poor rock, clip the first bolt and move out onto the face. Tackle some easy face climbing and move out onto the arete. Slap, pinch, and palm your way through the first crux (around bolt 4), move onto the left face and milk a great rest in large incut pockets. Begin the second crux directly above. It involves some tricky pocket sequences. Move back onto the face and run to the anchors. The final 30 ft is fairly easy, however a good pump could send you packing.

# Location
Furthest route left in the dehidrals. Take the Prophet wall path to it.

# Protection
Eight bolts, two bolt anchor`
