# Description
An engaging sequential climb with plenty of bolts and two distinct cruxes that shares an anchor with

Wedding Day

. Previously a dirty route, this has cleaned up immensely. Loose rock at the top is long gone, however would recommend a stick clip because the easy jugs/flake getting up to and past the first bolt sound very hollow. The first crux is getting off the ledge and involves a brief encounter with a mono. Rest up at a jug pocket and tackle the second crux which climbs close to the arete, though the easiest sequence doesn't actually involve using it at all. Hang on and clip a few more bolts until the sequential pockets give way to a juggy ledge and the anchors.
