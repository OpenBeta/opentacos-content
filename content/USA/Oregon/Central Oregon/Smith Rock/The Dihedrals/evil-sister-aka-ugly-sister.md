# Description
This rarely done line sits abandoned next to Chain Reaction. Often viewed as an "unpure" line due to a stem in between the first and second bolt. However, the stem only brings the route down a letter grade. Reachy movement on decent pockets leads you to the roof. Here you must gain a good pinch, clip, and deadpoint a small ergonomic nub. Healhook mantle your way to the chains.

# Location
Left of Chain Reaction

# Protection
Four bolts
