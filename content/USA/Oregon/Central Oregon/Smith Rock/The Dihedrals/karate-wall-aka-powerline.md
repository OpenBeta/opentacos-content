# Description
This intimidating line which begins just left of

Karate Crack

is one of Smith's full-on endurance test pieces. Originally climbed with bolts and removable gear for protection, the route has recently been retrobolted.

Even though the most difficult move is between  the 4th and 5th bolts there are several sections of comparable difficulty enroute to the chain anchors.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Quick Draws (11 / 12) for bolt hangers and one camming unit (blue TCU) or stopper for the seam  between the 5th and 6th bolts.
