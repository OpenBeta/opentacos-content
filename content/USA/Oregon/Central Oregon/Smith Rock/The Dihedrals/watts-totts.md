# Description
A great route with delicate climbing and fun moves.  Start on the shelf on the left side of the Latest Rage buttress and climb an aesthetic face that gets a little harder the higher you go.  The middle is tough, but the ending is no walk.

# Location
The Dihedrals.

# Protection
Sport.
