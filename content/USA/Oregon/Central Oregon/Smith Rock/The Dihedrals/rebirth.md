# Description
This route makes a good option for those wanting something a little different from the usual smith face climbing or wanting to learn chimney tech. crux is prob the start or the finish depending on climbers height. Recommended stick clip. The chockstone in the crack is pretty solid (we gave it some serious testing) but I would still recommend doing it without using it. Enjoy!

# Location
The large Chimney 15 feet to the left of Chain Reaction. Look for bolts on the outside edge of the wide chimney.

# Protection
4 Bolts. Anchor with rap chains.
