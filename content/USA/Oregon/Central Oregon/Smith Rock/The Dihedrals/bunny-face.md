# Description
Fantastic and easy face climbing.  First pitch follows the pillar face to a bolted anchor.  Second pitch moves down and right off the pillar and onto the adjacent face (same as for Bookworm) for more face climbing.  Can be done in one pitch (bring slings for the anchor and consider skipping the first bolt of the second pitch.)  Descend on two rope rappel or two raps.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
lots of quickdraws, some slings if running it in one pitch.
