# Description
A very popular easy route, Cinnamon Slab climbs the large right-facing corner separating the Dihedrals from lower angle and more broken rock to the east.  While technically two pitches, most parties seem to finish on Cry Babies or Cinnamon Toast instead.

P1.  From the base of Karate Crack, Cinnamon Slab  takes the low-angle hand and fist crack to a comfortable bolted belay on a good ledge.  The moves are good and thoughtful for the grade. 5.6

P2.  A short section of face climbing leads to an easier, shallow dihedral and the upper anchor.  5.5

# Location
To descend, make two single rope raps down the route.  A second anchor on top of P1 helps reduce congestion.

# Protection
Gear to 3.5".  I would recommend 2 large pieces unless you are fairly comfortable at the grade.  The climb takes great gear the whole way from solid stances, with some decent moves between.  This is a great climb for new leaders.
