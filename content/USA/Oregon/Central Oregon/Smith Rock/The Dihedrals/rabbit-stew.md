# Description
Climb the left corner of the Bunny Face pillar (the sister climb of Lycopodophyta, the right corner).  Wicked fun and mellow finger locks give way to the occasional jam.  Really nice face moves all the way.  Fantastic feet.  Uses the Bunny Face anchors.

Has a second pitch which is presumably unrecommended.
