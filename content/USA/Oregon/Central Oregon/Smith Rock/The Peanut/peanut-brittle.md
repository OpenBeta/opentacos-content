# Description
A slightly runout climb that shoots up the middle of The Peanut at the bottom and meets up with the finish of

Pop Goes the Nubbin

.

It may seem a little silly to add a "PG-13" rating to a climb like this, but a leader should feel comfortable on knobby runout terrain; there are definately better-protected 5.8s in the park if you're looking for an easy first lead or something.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
6 bolts to a bolted anchor.
