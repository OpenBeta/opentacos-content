# Description
I only climbed the 11a first pitch, but pitches 3, 4, and 5 I have climbed when doing 'Zebra Zion.'  The first pitch is fairly long and gives a good leg pump, but there are plenty of good shakes.  The moves that are in the 10c section and which the book says makes a great climb on its own are the hardest.  High-stepping is very beneficial.  That said, if you make it through to the first set of anchors you should keep going because it's not any more difficult.  However the gear sucks through the 11- section and a long fall is pretty much guaranteed if you let go...so don't. Great rock and cool moves.

Pitches 3, 4, and 5 can be checked out on the 'Zebra Zion' link.

# Location
The Morning Glory Wall.  The dihedral just left of the tree.

# Protection
There are five bolts on the route, if you clip one of the anchors on top of the 10c section and the bolt one foot above the anchor which has emerged out of the wall about a 1/2 inch. Otherwise, bring a set of nuts, a few small cams (metolious 00-4), and a few medium cams (metolious 6,7,8).  Just before the 11- section that the book shows you can place a bomber #4, an okay #00, or a fairly bad small stopper (or all if you want).  The bolt that looms above has great holds to clip from, but just make sure you get to them.
