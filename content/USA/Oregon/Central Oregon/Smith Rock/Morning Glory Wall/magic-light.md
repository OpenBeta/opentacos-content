# Description
Shares the first couple of bolts with Overboard.  Another great warmup if you only climb the lower 5.11b pitch as most people do.  A thin and pumpy crux finishes off this fine pitch

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
9 bolts to a bolted anchor, or keep going through 7 more to the top of the second pitch
