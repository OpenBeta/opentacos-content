# Description
This is kind of a silly link up but, it's there and worth doing just for the name alone.

Start on the first three bolts of Taco Chips. Make the hard pull to the slopey hole just up and left of the 3rd bolt, then take the shallow mono to the right. Continue traversing right towards Sign of the Times and throw for the jug near the 3rd bolt of Sign (Use at least a foot-long sling on this bolt to reduce drag). From here, simply go straight up through the V7 boulder problem and send.. Ideally you do this on a Tuesday so you can stop at the Pumphouse bar and grill for 3 dollar taco Tuesday afterward. Enjoy!

# Location
First 3 bolts of Taco Chips then traverse rightward into Sign of the Times.
