# Description
This route climb the attractive left-arching corner system a short distance to the right of

Zebra

and shares anchors with that route.

* Originally led without bolts, this was a serious lead; it was later retro-bolted and has became a popular (and safe) lead.

Lieback, jam and stem your way up the corner taking full advantage of the many edges for your feet, and occasionally your hands, to a crux at the very top of the route.

An excellent climb with technical movement and a heartbreaker crux at the top (for those who pitch off there). There are no real stopper moves on this route, and if you climb efficiently and don't get overly pumped it's in the bag.

# Location
You'll find this route immediately right of

Zebra Direct

and two routes to the right of

Gumby

.

# Protection
8 bolts, 2 bolt anchor/rap
