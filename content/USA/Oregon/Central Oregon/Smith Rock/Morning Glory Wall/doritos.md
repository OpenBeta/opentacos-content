# Description
Climb through fun jugs on Cool Ranch flavor and then traverse into the Taco Chips Rest at the 5th Bolt where you are then met with a balancy crux on small side pulls, pockets, and crimps. This route is fun, and exciting as you side pull and high step your way through a pumpy dash for the chains.

Climb up Cool Ranch. Put a long draw at bolt #4. Clip #5. Traverse right and clip the Taco Chips bolt to the left of the rail and then back clean bolt #5 of Cool Ranch. No new bolts were added with this link up. Enjoy!

# Location
Starts left of the direct Taco Chips start on Cool Ranch Flavor, Right of 9 Gallon Buckets
