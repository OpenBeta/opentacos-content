# Description
This devious line doesn't have the same stunning appearance as other Smith classics, but if you like challenging movement in a relatively secluded location, this route has a lot to offer.

Often described as, 'girl climbing', this route requires excellent balance and technical skills, but not as much power as other Smith 13s.  The cruxes involve sequential liebacking maneuvers, and at times it may feel more like you're climbing a crack than a face.

Though quite short, this route is difficult the entire way.

# Location
Immediately right of Da Kine Corner, begin at the same spot on the boulder, but begin by traversing to the right, then up into the right-most bolt line.

# Protection
Bolts.  Use a stick clip for the first bolt.
