# Description
This choss pile is actually cleaning up nicely and host some great movement. Besides the balancy and crimpy crux, most of the route has good holds with big moves on a slight overhang. I enjoy this route more than Taco Chips but it still has some flaky rock up top. Most of the hand holds are good but watch your foot placements.

If you have no other new 5.13's in the park to try that interest you, I would give this one a try. It is a quick tick for a strong climber.
