# Description
this route is part 3 of the churning series: first climb churning in the wake (13a), then do some fun and weird moves off the anchor (after a nice rest) followed by a trickly clip.  continue on past another mild crux, clip a few more, then do a hard crux (tiny crimp for left, mono for right) and quick pop for jug.  If you miss jug, its a fun cartoon fall: both hand are flailing in space while your feet remain on a huge "cave" bucket.

From here, you have done (almost) churning sky, (still 13a, so go figure that one), try to get a rest, because then its a full sprint for the ozone anchors (about 30 more feet and two hard clips with a few more cruxes). Great fun, lots of types of climbing, few painful holds, lots of endurance, adn great finish to the anchors (and have fun on the final clip!)
