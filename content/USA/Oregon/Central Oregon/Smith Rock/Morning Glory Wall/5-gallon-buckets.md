# Description
The huge huecos of 5 Gallon Buckets are often the first piece of rock that a climber touches on his or her first trip to the park.  The fun and consistent 5.8 climbing is straightforward and enjoyable as a warmup or a toprope.  A Smith classic!

This is the left-most route on the big huecoed section of the wall.  There's one bolt that can't be seen from the ground (it's in one of the big huecos), so remember to bring a 'draw for it.

Due to its central location and easy grade this is possibly the most popular route at Smith Rock.  There is almost always a rope up on it and a crowd of people at the base.  It receives early morning sun and keeps it all day, making it a good starting point for the cold days.
