# Description
Smith Rock's version of an 8,000 meter peak, Main Line rises high above the Morning Glory wall. It begins by climbing the start(and crux) of Energy Crisis, then traverses left into a shallow scoop just right of Lion's Chair. You'll find technical & highly interesting stemming for several bolts (main crux), followed by a pumping 5.11 crack. At the 100 ft mark you get another large rest, followed by the redpoint crux: a butthole puckering 50 ft slab of flawless red stone. From here to the summit felt similar to climbing Watts Tots.

A highly involved, but worthwhile endeavor.

# Location
Just left of Magic Light.

# Protection
14 bolts. Use long slings.

Convience minded climbers should consider using a 90+ meter rope. Otherwise use the rap station at the 100 ft mark.
