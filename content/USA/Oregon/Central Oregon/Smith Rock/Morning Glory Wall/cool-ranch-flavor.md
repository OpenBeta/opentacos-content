# Description
While this is certainly a one-sequence wonder route, it's a lot of fun.  The crux section is just before the anchors and involves technical long reach moves.  It however can be cheated by staying left in the shallow dihedral and risking a pendulum fall in ~10- terrain.  The moves up to the crux are on a much easier pocketed seam, but they are still enjoyable.

# Location
Just right of

Nine Gallon Buckets

and left of Taco Chips.  Starts in a pocketed seam.

# Protection
Bolts.  Rap Anchors.
