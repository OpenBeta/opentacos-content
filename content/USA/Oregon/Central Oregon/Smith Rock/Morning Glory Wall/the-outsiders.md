# Description
A popular but somewhat controversial newer addition to Morning Glory Wall.  Placed somewhat tightly between Five Gallon Buckets and Light on the Path, not everyone thought this was a necessary addition to the wall.  The moderate grade and fun moves have made it one of the more popular routes in a very heavily used area.  Edges, pockets and knobs are all a part of this route.  Crux is about 2/3rds up.

# Location
On the left side of Morning Glory Wall, just right of  5 Gallon Buckets.

# Protection
8 bolts and Mussy hooks at the anchor
