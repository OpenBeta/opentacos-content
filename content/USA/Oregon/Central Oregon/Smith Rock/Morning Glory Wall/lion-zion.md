# Description
Wow, this one's a doozey!

Start out on Gumby or Zebra Direct for the first 55 feet and pass the anchor at the top of Zebra Direct. Keep going up and right past some spaced out bolts on little nubs and edges. A bolted anchor comes just in time at about the same height as the second pitch of Zebra Zion. Descend in two raps with a 60m rope.

# Location
Just right of

Zion

dihedral

# Protection
lots of draws (couple long) maybe 18....
