# Description
Morning Sky is the natural extension of

Gumby

.  After climbing through the technical and balancy crux of

Gumby

, find a rest in the giant huecos and shake out.  Instead of following the huecos up and right (5.easy), continue straight up on small pockets and crimps.  The climbing on this upper section is pumpy and technical, and similar in character to the start of

Gumby

.  This is one of my favorite routes on the Morning Glory Wall.
