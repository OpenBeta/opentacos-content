# Description
Another Morning Glory moderate.  This is a good alternative to the adjacent 5 Gallon Buckets and Outsiders if there are people on them.  It is  more difficult than its neighbor with a crux getting off the ground, and then near the top towards the top.

The route is found between

The Outsiders

and

Gumby

on the huecoed section of the Morning Glory Wall.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Route is protected by 8 bolts and a bolted anchor. Bring your own draws, as the steel ones are getting pretty worn.
