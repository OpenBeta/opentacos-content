# Description
Links up lower taco chips into cool ranch flavor. The crux is getting past the first 4 bolts on Taco Chips, but expect a hard and balancy 5.11 move under the first set of anchors followed by moderate 5.11 moves with good rest.

# Location
Right of Nine Gallon Buckets

# Protection
10 bolts
