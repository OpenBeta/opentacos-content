# Description
A text book Smith Rocks edge nightmare. Expect solid 11 climbing through the first three bolts to a nasty traverse crux. An excellent rest leads to the next crux where the white rock meets the high quality red stone. Sidepull and highstep your way through this one and you're on your way to a edgy 11- section for the next four bolts.

# Location
Right of Cool Ranch Flavor. Left of Sign of the Times.

# Protection
10 bolts, 2 bolt anchor
