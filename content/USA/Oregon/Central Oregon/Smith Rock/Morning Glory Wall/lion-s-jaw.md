# Description
This is actually a 3 pitch route, but almost no one climbs past the 1st pitch due to the last two pitches  being chossy unprotected chimneys.  This covers the first pitch, which is a very good route that borders on classic.  The first 3/4 of the route is in a solid dihedral.  The finish is pulling a small roof that isn't harder than the moves below.

# Location
Left side of Morning Glory Wall in a dihedral right of Tammy Baker's Face and the Peanut.

# Protection
Gear to 1 1/2 inches.  Rap Anchors
