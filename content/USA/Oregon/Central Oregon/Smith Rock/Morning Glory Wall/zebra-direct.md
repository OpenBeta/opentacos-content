# Description
Thin, tricky moves on small edges and rounded scallops lead to a crux about half way up.  The crux is a little before the lip where the climbing turns 5.5 for the remainder of the route.  If you follow the wrong chalked holds you may find yourself in a hard to backtrack dead-end like many others before you.

# Location
Left side of Morning Glory Wall, just left of the left-arching line, Zebra Seam.

# Protection
4 bolts and rap anchors.  These Top Anchors are shared with the routes, Gumby, Zebra Seam and the first pitch of Zebra or Zebra/Zion.
