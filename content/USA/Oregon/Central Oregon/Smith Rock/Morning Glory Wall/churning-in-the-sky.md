# Description
This is the second route in the Churning Series.

Continue past the first anchor of Churning In The Wake to a rest. Stay calm through easy 5.11 climbing to another rest and then get psyched for a  technical, one-move crux to a jug. Several sequences will work through this section depending on your height / weight / ape-index / dietary restrictions and preference of Chocolate vs Vanilla.

Finish up and right on the Delicious Fish anchors.

# Location
Churning Buttress

# Protection
Almost always has hung draws.
