# Description
A very insecure start with a pretty desperate stab to a good pocket gets things going on this aesthetic arete. Two more crux sections await, and there's a spicy runout before the last bolt once the real business is behind you. Be sure to save some gas for the last move though.

I found the movement to be pretty awkward and it felt very hard for the grade. I had a much easier time with the cruxes on The Quickening (.12c), but if delicate aretes are your thing then this is a good route.

Start on the boulder by stick clipping the first bolt (!), then step off onto the good rail and a few good footholds.

# Location
Far right corner of the Churning Buttress on the Morning Glory Wall.  Belay from below the boulder.

# Protection
A stick clip is absolutely required.  Nobody in their right mind would try to climb through the lower crux before the first bolt without it pre-clipped.
