# Description
This is the lone route on the Morning Glory Wall in the corralled area (right of Zebra Seam, left of Lion's Chair).  Dandy Line follows a left leaning seam for approximately fifty feet and ends at some small huecos.  You'll have to climb intuitively as there is almost no chalk on the route.
