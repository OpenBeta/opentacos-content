# Description
This seldom-climbed '80s sport route is a variation to Zion's 4th pitch, with standard Smith crimping and pockets on the clean upper headwall of Morning Glory. The first 4 bolts are tenuous slab, leading into a technical crux section in the middle. After reaching a good rest, execute some spidery pocket sequences at the top.

To descend, rappel from the ledge (80m rope or two ropes makes it to the ground in two raps, otherwise 3 raps with a 60m). You can also top out and walk off, climbing above the anchor onto a crumbling ledge to join the finish of Zion.

The belay ledge and route itself are very clean, but it's probably best saved for less busy midweek days at the park just in case of rockfall.

# Location
Continue straight up the corner where Zion's 3rd pitch traverses right, in 30 feet you will end up on a great ledge big enough for four.

# Protection
13 bolts, chain anchor below the summit. A few small cams and mostly hand-size gear for Zion. A #6 cam makes a nice backup piece for hanging out on the big ledge.
