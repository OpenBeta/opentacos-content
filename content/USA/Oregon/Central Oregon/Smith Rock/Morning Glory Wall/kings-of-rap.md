# Description
Excellent position and awesome movement characterize this four star route. Begin on a slab boulder across from the route. Step across and begin pulling on good pockets. Once you clip bolt 3 the business begins, make a long reach to great pockets, then move out to a ledge. More tenuous pockets await. At the 5th bolt the first crux begins, shallow pockets combined with a strange stem lead you to better sidepulls. Move into good stemming rest before the roof. Great holds lead you to the head wall. The next crux involves some arete pinching with a long reach. The climbing does not ease from there, as a pump crux may foil your send.

Note: most of the pockets of this route have been drilled, but what route at Smith doesn't have some manufacturing.
