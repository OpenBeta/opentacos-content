# Description
A great pitch that often gets used as a warm up for the 5.13s to the right on the Churning Buttress.  It sees a lot of traffic, but with good reason.  Typical Smith Rock crimps and pockets abound.

It's a fun route to jump on at the end of the day for one last burn on the way back to the car if nobody's on it.

The start is 15-20ft. to the right of the tree at the base of the Morning Glory wall, just around the corner from the Zebra/

5 Gallon Buckets

area.

To the second set of anchors is 11d and can be TR'd with a 70m.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
8 bolts to a bolted anchor, or continue past another 5 bolts to a higher anchor.
