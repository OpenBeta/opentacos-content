# Description
Start up fun easy climbing on perfect features. Clip and begin trending left towards the arete. Use a combination of arete holds and feet on the face to reach an obvious pocket. From here, make a thoughtful tricky move back onto the face, latch the anchor jugs, and clip the chains.

# Location
Left side of the south wall: the left-hand line of a pair of obvious bolted routes on the reddish weathered slab beneath the bulbous overhang

# Protection
4 bolts, chain anchors
