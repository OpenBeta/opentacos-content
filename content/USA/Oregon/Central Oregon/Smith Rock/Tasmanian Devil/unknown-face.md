# Description
Really good holds whenever you need them. Maybe slightly reachy at times, but lots of smaller holds in between the really big, ergonomic ones. Pretty much a straight line up to the third bolt then slight leftward traverse to the anchor.

# Location
South wall, left side. Right-hand route on the reddish slab.

# Protection
3 bolts, chain anchors
