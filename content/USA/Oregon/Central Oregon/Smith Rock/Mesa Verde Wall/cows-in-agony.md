# Description
Cows in Agony is a one pitch sport route on the center of the Mesa Verde Wall, just uphill and south from the excellent Reason to Be.

Start just right of a wide crack.  Opening moves are tough, consider stick clipping the first bolt.  Continue up, staying left of the bolt line.  I hate to use the word 'contrived' but this one really felt it.  I was way left following the holds and making big reaches right to clip. This route inexplicably gets three stars in the new Watts guide.

Step to center at the final bolt and execute a neat sequence to top out on the ledge and clip the old anchor.

# Location
South but uphill from reason to be on Mesa Verde wall.

# Protection
6 lead bolts, 2 bolt anchor.
