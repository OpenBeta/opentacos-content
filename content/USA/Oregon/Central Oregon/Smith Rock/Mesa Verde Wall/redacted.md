# Description
This pitch starts at the anchor atop

Sundown

. Climb the face above the dihedral on small knobs and edges veering left to the anchor above the crux of Mingas Morgul. The traverse left is a bit runout.

This can be combined with

Sundown

into one long lead. (recommended)

Either Rap from here with one 60m or continue on for one more pitch of 5.9 up Mingas Morgul to the ledge where Tale finishes.
