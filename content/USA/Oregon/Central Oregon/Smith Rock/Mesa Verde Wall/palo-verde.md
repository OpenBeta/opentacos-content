# Description
[No longer a nailing route, this has been freed at 5.13a]

Best nailing route at smith. A3 in the Watts guide. As always aid ratings are subjective.

P1 - 4th class - Scramble up to the 4th class ledge, belay from two bolts.

P2 - 5.6 A2+ - Free climb up to the aid cracks, begin on clean aid with aliens, aid past retro bolt belay into a shallow diheadral, belay from bolts, below roof.

P3 - 5.4 A2+ - Pull the roof on a fixed KB and continue up the crack, the rock gets rotten but there are a few 3 bolts and a belay 20ft below the top. Aid past below free climb through the killer top out, belay from juniper tree. (only one bolt is original from the FA)

# Location
The biggest steepest part of the Mesa Verde Wall

# Protection
Full aid rack to with cams to 2inches. Sawed angles and beaks are helpfull.
