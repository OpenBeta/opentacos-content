# Description
An excellent three pitch climb follows the right-hand side of the formation. The 2nd pitch is great climbing.

Pitch 1:

Climb a slightly chossy corner system for about 80 feet to a gear belay at the base of the dihedral. (uncomfortable belay)

5.7

Pitch 2: Jam the clean dihedral until the crack veers right then climb a strenous finger crack through a bulge to a fat ledge with a bolt anchor.

10.a

Pitch 3:

A bit spooky! Climb the face above and left of the anchor past a few bolts to a decent runout on small nubbins (5.9) to the big ledge above.

5.9R

The easiest way off is to traverse the ledge above the 3rd pitch to the anchor at the top of the Trezlar dihedral and rap from there with two ropes.

# Location
Right of

Bad Moon Rising

there is a large block leaning against the face, it has two bolts on it. The second crack system to the right of the block is Tale.

# Protection
gear to 3" with an extra hand size for the anchor on top of pitch 1.
