# Description
Spicy.

Climb the arete to the right of

Tale of Two Shitties

using the arete and crimps. The climbing and rock are excellent, the bolts are a bit spaced making it a lil' scary. Bolts anywhere other than where they are would be extremely hard to clip. Perhaps a bit hard for the grade (aren't all 10.d's at Smith?)
