# Description
An exciting and well protected route that epitomizes the adventure of climbing obscure trad routes at Smith.  Start on easy climbing heading towards a somewhat unnecessary bolt.  A brief section of fingers leads into a flare.  Pick a shoulder to lead with and go for it, its very strenuous, slightly dirty, and very awkward.  At the top of the chimney flare exit using the crack to the left.  A very needed rest welcomes you here before the bolt protected lieback crux, great handholds with no feet here, but you'll hit a ledge soon.  Above this bolt I saw a lot of loose blocks but it's not hard to avoid them.  The anchors are pretty high, and there isn't much hard climbing getting to them.  A 70M rope only reaches on rappel with all gear clean and no knots in the rope!

# Location
Between Juniper Face and the Reason to Be Arete, look for the chimney and a bolt low down.

# Protection
Lots of slings! especially for the top. lots of yellow to red Metolius are nice, and a #3 Camalot size was nice for pulling the roof.  A sling might be nicer than harness racking on this one.
