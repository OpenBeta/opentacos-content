# Description
Shadow of Doubt is very sustained and technical for the grade.  Begin at "Reason to Be," but head right from the starting holds.  From the second bolt the climbing stays 11ish, seperated by three distinct cruxes: a crimpy section above the second bolt, a tricky roof above the third bolt, and another crimpy section above the roof.  Traverse left to the anchors for Reason to Be.

# Location
The route just right of "Reason to Be."

# Protection
bolts.
