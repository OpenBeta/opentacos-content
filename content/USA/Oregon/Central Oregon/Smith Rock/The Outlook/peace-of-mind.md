# Description
Start out on 5.8 climbing to the 3rd bolt, where the angle kicks back and the 5.11 climbing is in your face. Although the rock quality isn't amazing till the 3rd bolt, its easy and worth it to get to the rock solid overhang! Either top out and clip the anchors at the top or clip them at your waist. THis route can easily be top roped as well. Just climb up to the top of the spire  (4th class) and rig a top rope

# Location
Only route on the spire, the description on the outlook webpage will get you here.

# Protection
5 bolts plus anchors
