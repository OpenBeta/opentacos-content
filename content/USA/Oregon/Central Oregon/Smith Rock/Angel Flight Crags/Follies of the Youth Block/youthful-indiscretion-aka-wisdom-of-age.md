# Description
Despite being out of the way and short, this route has some fun moves right off the ground and continues up and over a bulge to easy climbing on a slab to the anchors. The crux can be interesting for many to figure out as they are trying to get both feet off the ground. A shoulder start is another option and gives your friends a good laugh.

# Location
This route is the left most of two bolted lines on Follies of Youth Block.

# Protection
4 bolts. Anchors.
