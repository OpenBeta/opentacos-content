# Description
One of the better arete lines at Smith. Ascends a perfect north facing corner with great views of the Cascade range. Perfect stone and perplexing movement. A bit more bouldery than the usual route.

Begins with a savage intro boulder problem that would go at v11 in its own right, where you must wrestle a steep double arete, tossing between terrible holds. You get a brief shake in this steep portion prior to tackling the exit v7 boulder problem. From there you have an excellent mid 12 arete to the summit.

# Location
Just up hill from help liberation there's a small deer trail. Or access it by walking up river from the Spiderman buttress.

This is on the small cliff, Pillar of the Community, between Snake Rock and Spiderman Buttress in the Angel Flight Crags.

# Protection
7 bolts and anchors
