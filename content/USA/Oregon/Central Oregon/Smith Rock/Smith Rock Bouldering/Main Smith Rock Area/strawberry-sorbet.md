# Description
Start low on a left sidepull and right pinch. Move up to a crimp with your right and bump your left up to one of the many good holds. Make a heel assisted reachy move around the right of the boulder and top out a little off to the right.

# Location
(Disclaimer: I'm pulling these directions from memory, so they may be a bit off)

Starting from the picnic area, cross the bridge and follow the river trail south towards the Dihedrals. Maybe ~200m or less from the Dihedrals, you'll walk beneath some tree coverage and an obvious trail opens up on your lefthand side. There you'll find a few climbable boulders, two of which are Strawberry Sorbet and Charlotte's Web.

This is a rough approximation of where I believe it is.

# Protection
2 pads should be enough. Be cautious because its on an incline with loose soil so your pads or spotters may slide.
