# Description
This is a short route, so make sure you do a sit start. Nice overhanging route with big jugs!

The easiest descent route is fairly straightforward and obvious. Use the lowest end of the boulder near the trees.

# Location
From Monkey Face, walk downhill towards Kiss of the Lepers Buttress and towards the river on the river trail. Once you reach the bottom of the trail, it's just about two minutes walk to reach the Monkey Boulder.

With your back to the river and facing the boulder, start just to the left of the tree located on the right side.

# Protection
None
