# Location
(Disclaimer: I'm pulling these directions from memory, so they may be a bit off)

Starting from the picnic area, cross the bridge and follow the river trail south towards the Dihedrals. Maybe ~200m or less from the Dihedrals, you'll walk beneath some tree coverage and an obvious trail opens up on your lefthand side. There you'll find a few climbable boulders, two of which are Strawberry Sorbet and Charlotte's Web.

This is a rough approximation of where I believe it is.
