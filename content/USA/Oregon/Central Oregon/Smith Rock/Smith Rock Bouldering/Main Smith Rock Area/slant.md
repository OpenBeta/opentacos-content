# Description
The static version of Eagle. Follow the left slanting crack up the face.

Start on the same rail as Eagle and once again bump your left hand to the loose feeling jug. Instead of doing a dyno to the top, reach out left with your right hand and slot it in the crack against the solid side pull. Left hand right above that and then reach out right to the same finishing jug as Eagle. Mantle over and walk off.

(This problem has certainly been climbed before, feel free to inform me on the correct name and beta if you know it.)

# Location
On the overhanging face of what I dubbed the "Rail Boulder". It is located nearby the bivy wall bouldering area in a section Alan Watts refers to as "mini-boulders".

# Protection
Crash pad, spotter
