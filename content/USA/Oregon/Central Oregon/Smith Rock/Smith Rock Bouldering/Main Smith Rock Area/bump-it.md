# Description
A dumb little arete on the uphill right side of the vertical face of what I dubbed the Trapezoid boulder. Start right hand as low as you can go and left hand on a good side pull pocket. Bump right then left hand the whole way up the arete. Mind the tree branch at the top.

Walk off opposite side of boulder or downclimb.

(This problem has certainly been climbed before, feel free to inform me on the correct name and beta if you know it.)

# Location
On the vertical face of what I dubbed the Trapezoid Boulder in the area referred to as mini-boulders by Alan Watts near the bivy bouldering wall.

# Protection
Crash pad, spotter
