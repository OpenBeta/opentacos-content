# Description
Start on a 2.5 finger pocket with the left hand and a sharp half pad crimp for the right, feet on good ledges below. Right hand out to a good side pull pocket and then launch up to a jug pocket with the left. Finish straight up from there.

Either walk off the opposite side or downclimb this route or "Bump It" on the arete to the right, minding the tree.

(This problem has certainly been climbed before, feel free to inform me on the correct name and beta if you know it.)

# Location
On a boulder I dubbed the "Trapezoid Boulder". It is in an area Alan Watts refers to as the mini-Boulders nearby the bivy bouldering wall.

# Protection
Crash pad, spotter
