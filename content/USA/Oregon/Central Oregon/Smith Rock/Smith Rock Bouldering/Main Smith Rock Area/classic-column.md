# Description
This is one very aesthetic boulder problem. While most of the difficulty lies in committing as it’s a little tall, the are some great sidepulls on the left and right of this massive refrigerator. Finish with a positive lip and good feet.

# Location
The very obvious  southwest facing column nestled between Volk’s Boulder and Little Fella.

# Protection
Pretty flat base for pads. One to two pads should be adequate.
