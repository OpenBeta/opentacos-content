# Description
Start with your hands on the rail, bumping your left hand to the loose feeling jug on the left. Set your feet and launch for the top.

(This problem has certainly been climbed before, feel free to inform me on the correct name and beta if you know it.)

# Location
This route is on the overhanging face of what I dubbed the "Rail Boulder". It's located in what Alan Watts referred to as mini-boulders near the bivy bouldering area.

# Protection
Crash pad, spotter
