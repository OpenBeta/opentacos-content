# Description
Slopers and pinches with plenty of core summarize this worthwhile climb. SDS on the left hand crimp and right sloper and work up and left. There looks like an exit to the right, but it would be much more dynamic and maybe harder.

# Location
Northern point, in the pines SE of the bend in the river

# Protection
Pad or two
