# Description
Interesting movement that starts low down in the corner and finishes sneaking left onto the ledge after the knob (avoiding the lichen covered top out). Better hold choices exist out right after the underclings/scoop, but they probably wonâ€™t help much and create harder movement to the crimps before the knob

# Location
Left side of the Gorilla Cliff starting low in the corner

# Protection
pad or two, not very tall but wandering fall area
