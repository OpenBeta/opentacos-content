# Description
This is another cool independent line at Gorilla Cliff, though probably not quite as cool as Five and Dime. Sit start at a good pocket and edge combo, climb easily up to a huge undercling, then funk and deadpoint your way through a series of edges out the lip past an oblong slopey pocket at about head height. Top out more or less straight up. This problem is probably a bit height-dependent.

# Location
See photo, about 10 feet right of the obvious mini-offset that forms the exit moves of Five and Dime.

# Protection
A pad or two.
