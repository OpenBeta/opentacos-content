# Description
Sit start in the cave on opposing side pulls, this route moves up and out through the left scoop, stem and reach from solid hold to solid hold until you gain the deep undercling, throw for the lip and heelhook or mantel your way over the bulge. the finish felt like the crux for me but may be easier with tall beta.

# Location
As you walk down the little side trail you'll note a small shallow roof, this problem is the first legit problem you'll encounter. Look for the SDS and the obvious left scoop.

# Protection
Boulder.
