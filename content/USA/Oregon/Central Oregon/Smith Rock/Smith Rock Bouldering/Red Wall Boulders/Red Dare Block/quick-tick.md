Stand start, with right hand in a 3 finger pocket, left hand on a good crimp. A few moves and you gain the slopers at the lip, prepare for a difficult mantle and beached whale your way over the top.

There are a few large detached cheat stones which are obviously off.

Left side of the Red Dare Block, look for the right hand finger hole.
