# Description
Rated D5+ or 5.11+. This was established as a Dry Tooling route where those of the alpine persuasion can practice the Dark Arts of scratching up rock using ice tools and crampons. Climbing shoes weather permitting make for a fun outing as well. Bolted. Mental crux is clipping 3rd bolt. Upper section involves wild steeming and creative torquing. Rap anchors installed. The section of the wall to the right of Soft Asylum is the Torque Wall and all 6 routes are approved for Dry Tooling and or Sport climbing.

# Location
This is one of 6 Dry Tooling routes established that start just to the right of Soft Asylum. Put a Torque in It shares the same start as Torque Dat Axe, but moves left at the first bolt. You can clip the first bolt of Torque Dat Axe by standing on the boulder in front of the route to prevent a groud fall, and then once you are established on the route next to the first bolt you can reach out left and clip the official first bolt on Put a Torque in It. If you prefer the spice just launch from the ground up.

# Protection
Bolted.
