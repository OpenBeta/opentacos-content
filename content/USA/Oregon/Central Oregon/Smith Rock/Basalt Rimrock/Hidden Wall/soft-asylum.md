# Description
This route is actually really cool, requiring a handful of different skills, totally worth visiting on your way back to the car.  Funky, smeary, balancy, and then powerful, sustained, and sequential.  Crux hits at about the 3rd bolt (where most people stray a bit from the bolt line)with a (at first) perplexing sequence to and through a set of positive pockets.  A big move to a great hold, or more controlled moves with awful feet bring you to the arete where fun slaps and more pockets bring you to the chains.  Stays difficult till the clipping JUG!

# Location
Only route on the wall

# Protection
5 Bolts and an anchor (not equipped for lowering so go grab your draws from the top of the cliff)
