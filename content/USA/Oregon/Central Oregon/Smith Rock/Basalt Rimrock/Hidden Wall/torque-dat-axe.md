# Description
Rated D5 or 5.10a.  Just to the right of Put a Torque in It. Shares the same start with Put a Torque in It, which moves left at first bolt, while Torque dat Axe goes straight up. This was established as a Dry Tooling route where those of the alpine persuasion can practice the Dark Arts of scratching up rock using ice tools and crampons. Climbing shoes weather permitting make for a fun outing as well. Mixed gear and bolts. .03 to 3”. Green alien works well as first piece after second bolt. Mental crux is establishing above second bolt while placing gear before maneuvering above the steeper section above. Rap anchors installed. The section of the wall to the right of Soft Asylum is the Torque Wall and all 6 routes are approved for Dry Tooling and or Sport climbing.
