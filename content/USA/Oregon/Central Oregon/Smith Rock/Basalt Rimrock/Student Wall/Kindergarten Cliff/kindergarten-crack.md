# Description
Very short climb suitable for first time climbers. A nice little crack on a relaxed slope. As you would expect for the rating, there are always holds within easy reach, but some of them are small enough to make nonclimbers worry and sweat. People with any climbing experience at all should have no trouble.

# Location
On the right of Kindergarten Cliff, nearer to the textbooks than to the reproductive wall.

# Protection
Three bolts at the top. They are easily reached by hiking around the wall then following the path until you see them.
