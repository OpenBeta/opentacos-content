# Description
While Bonfire is nothing to write home about, it does act as a great warm-up for harder climbs in the area or a good climb for someone who likes just a hint of wide crack in there climb. The upper wide crack can easily be a lie back but the more technical off-width style is actually easier in terms of effort input.

# Location
this route splits into two at about half the way up the wall. it is the right of the two upper sections. No anchors on top. Build one.

# Protection
Gear to 4" is nice but can be climbed with no 4" piece if your comfortable with the grade.
