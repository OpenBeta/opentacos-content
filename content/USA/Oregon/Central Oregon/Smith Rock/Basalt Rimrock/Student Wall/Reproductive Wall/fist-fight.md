# Description
Scramble and scum to the ledge, then burly overhanging hands and fists to the jugs.

Be careful coming off the ledge into the overhanging crack so you don't deck.

Guidebook calls this .8, but that's a sandbag.

# Location
Rightmost option off the ledge above and to the right of Flunked Out.

# Protection
Fingers to thin hands pro for down low, hands for up high. I found a BD #4 useful.
