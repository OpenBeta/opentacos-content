# Description
The Graduate is a test of technique, power and endurance, with multiple difficult sections to test your skill and determination to pass this final exam. Starting off with a low crux (slab/corner/groove thing) to establish in the layback crack. Powerfull laybacking leads you into the meat of the climb which revolves around a crimp a pinch and a deadpoint to a sinker two finger sidepull pocket off of "ok" feet. Keep hanging on and try to rest under the roof so you're ready for the tiny pockets and edges to the chains.

# Location
Look for the steepest and gnarlest overhanging section on the reproductive wall. Dead center and in between "Keg Party" to the left and "Another A-Hole Hall Monitor" to the right.

# Protection
Bolts and chains
