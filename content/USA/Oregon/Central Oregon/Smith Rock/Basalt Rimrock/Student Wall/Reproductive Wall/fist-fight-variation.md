# Description
This route shares the first 5 bolts with "Summer School" then continues straight up through a powerful groove involving a deadpoint to a hand jam followed by a "gather your self" jug and into a tricky deadpoint / dyno sequence. Easy 5.10 climbing after the crux to the chains. Oh, did I mention theres a mantle...

# Location
Same start as "Hot for Teacher" and "Summer School". First route left of "Fight Song".

# Protection
10 bolts and chains
