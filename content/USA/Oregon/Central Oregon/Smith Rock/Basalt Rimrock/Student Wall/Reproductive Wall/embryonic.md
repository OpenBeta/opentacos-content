# Description
Really cool pockets lead to a crux that pulls you around a small roof.  The holds are good, but are sometimes far apart and even after the roof you need to stick it out until the anchors.

# Location
This route starts the same as Drilling Zona, but continues straight up from the ledges.

# Protection
Bolts.
