# Description
This route is not a difficult 5.11, but it is consistent and delicate, and earning of the grade.

# Location
On the far right end of the Repoductive Wall, this is the obvious and only bolted route to the right of "Cardiac Kid".

# Protection
6 bolts. Unlike much of Smith, the bolts are spaced very close together. There are anchors you can rappel from.
