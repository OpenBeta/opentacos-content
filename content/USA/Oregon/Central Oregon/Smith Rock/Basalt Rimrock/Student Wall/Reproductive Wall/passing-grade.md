# Description
Starts on a short crack. Edge past two cut bolts and finish up a left facing dihedral. The crux is at the start of the dihedral. The route protects well. Use double length slings to build an anchor on a big horn at the top of the route.

The walk off or top rope hike up option is to climbers left before the start of the Reproductive Wall.

# Location
Walk along the Reproductive Wall on the north side of the Crooked River until you see a route with two cut bolts above midway up. If you come across fully bolted routes you've gone 5 routes too far.

# Protection
Gear to 3" Optional to 3.5" Sling horns for anchors.
