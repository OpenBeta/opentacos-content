# Description
Fun moderate mixed route with a little bit of everything. Slab, Groovy/Chimney section, techy pockets and a crack section (need a .75 / .5 for the crack section). There is a hidden jug up top that makes the final moves from the last bolt to the anchor a bit more tolerable......

# Location
Move left at the 5th bolt of Fist Fight.

# Protection
9 bolts plus gear between the 7th and 8th bolts. Recommended gear, one .75 & one .5 BD cam.
