# Description
Pop up to an excellent undercling and step right. Then pull an 'annoyingly, awkward' crux over a small roof and stem to the top.

# Location
This route is up and around the corner to the right from the popular sport routes on this wall, including "Embryonic" and "Drilling Zona".

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches. The only option for an anchor is that on the sport route "Gridlocked" several feet to the right, unless you wish to top out and find a juniper.
