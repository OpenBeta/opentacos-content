# Description
Start on a well protected ramp to a horn. Either round the horn or go straight up. You're already at the top. Either sling a couple trees at the top or build an anchor. Easiest way out of the textbooks and a great way to retrieve anchors left at the top.

# Location
Farthest route right on the Textbooks. About 30 feet right of the Graduation Day.

# Protection
Single rack
