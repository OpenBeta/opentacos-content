# Description
A great route that only adds value to setting up the anchor on the Minotaur.  Due to the swing, even the TR has an air of intimidation.  Clipping a piece or two along the way, even for the toprope, isn't a bad idea.

Contrary to appearances, the moves aren't too bad until you get to where it meets up with Minotaur.  At that point, you run into a funky exit from the roof.  Go for it!  Highly recommended.

# Location
With your anchor on Minotaur, start as you would for Virgin Slayer, but boldly head right under the roof instead of left.

As with Minotaur, back this one bolt anchor up with the bolts behind it.

# Protection
Gear to 1" for the roof (cams would be nice), I think, and 2" for the finishing cracks.  Or just TR it.
