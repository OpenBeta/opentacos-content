# Description
Imposing roof, easiest route weasels awkwardly left to an exquisite hand/finger crack. Intimidating roof is worth the effort.

Starts in the corner right of the roof.

# Protection
If you protect the roof, bring slings - lots of rope drag. Pro to 3.5. Wide hands to fists at bulge. Anchors.
