# Description
Short route with medium-fun moves and decent rock.  Not the coolest 5.8 I've ever done, and currently it's got a lot of dirt on it. If you happen to be hanging out on the student wall, and you like 5.8, it wouldn't be a nightmare to climb this thing.

I think if it got cleaned up, it would be about ten times as fun.

# Location
Far right (climber's right) side of the Textbooks, just before the rock jumble.

# Protection
Gear to 3".  Single bolt anchor!
