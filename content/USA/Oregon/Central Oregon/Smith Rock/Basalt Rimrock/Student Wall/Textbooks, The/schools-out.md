# Description
Start up a right leaning large flake and into the off-width crack with a smaller crack next to it for protection. The crux comes high after the corner widens.

# Location
left of the only real bolted line in the textbooks (chalkboard). look for a crack that you can walk into.

# Protection
The book says gear to 2.5" but I used no larger than 1" and only one cam. It eats nuts. Rap anchors on top.
