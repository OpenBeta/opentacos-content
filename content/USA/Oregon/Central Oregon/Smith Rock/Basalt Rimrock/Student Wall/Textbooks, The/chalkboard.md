# Description
Getting off the ground is a pain, but there are a few good moves following the start. The finish gets tougher, and there is no anchor at the top, so toprope is suggested. Don't mind the loose slab of rock stuck in the wall halfway up the face; it's not coming out of the wall.

# Location
This is the only bolted route on The Textbooks, located just to the right of "School's Out".

# Protection
3 bolts. There are anchors several feet to the left, or around the arete to the right. Protected at the beginning, the finish can feel a bit sketchy on lead.
