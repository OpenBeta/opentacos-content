# Description
A flaring slot with crappy finger locks for the first twenty feet make this feel like it would fit in better in Yosemite than Smith.  I ended up knee scumming/chimneying to get through.  Really fun if you like that sort of thing.  The rest of the route is a walk.

Start behind a detached block, about twenty feet right of the Minotaur anchor.

# Location
Twenty feet right of the Minotaur anchor, start behind a detached block, in a flaring body-sized corner.

# Protection
Thin gear. Or just TR.
