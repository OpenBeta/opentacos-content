# Description
Fun, fairly straightforward 5.10 crack and face moves.  Just like any other basalt line, a nice opportunity to think about your feet. What else would you expect from a Textbooks 10c?  It's a bit dusty from lack of use, and doesn't have the history of Theseus or the Minotaur, but still recommended.

Watts describes loose block.  I tr soloed it, and never noticed anything too bad.  If it's still loose, you're, obviously, more likely to notice it on lead.

# Location
Climber's right side of the Textbooks.  From the top, working back from the rock jumble below the cliff, work back towards the Reproductive Wall. The first anchor (one bolt) is Graduation Day (5.8), the next (2 bolts) is Avant Garde (5.11b), and the next set is this route.

# Protection
Gear to 2", bolted anchors.
