# Description
The first 5.11 at Smith, Minotaur is insecure and technical.  It starts with a low angle layback, and then gets a little funky with sloping holds, crappy feet, and a couple of long reaches.  As quickly as you hit the crux, it is over, and you finish in a wide crack and a corner seam above.

Watts gives it 2 stars, but I thought it was more fun than that, and really exciting for the history.

# Location
Same toprope location as Labyrinth, the anchor is to the climber's right of the Virgin Slayer, on the right side of the Textbooks.

# Protection
Thin gear to lead.  TR also works great, but is only one bolt, so back it up with the other bolted anchor (ten feet back).
