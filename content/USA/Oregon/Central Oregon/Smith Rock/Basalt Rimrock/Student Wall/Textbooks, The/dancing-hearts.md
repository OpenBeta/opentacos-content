# Description
This route starts the same as Heart Throb until you reach the roof. At this point, clip the optional bolt and move into the crux shuffle right under the roof. The feet were probably once great but now the have rubbed those edges into a slick polished surface that makes the feet a little questionable. Move around the corner and try to avoid getting your rope eatan by the roof corner. Move left across the face to the left crack and top out. One bolt up top. Building an anchor is a little difficult but can be done.

# Location
Look for the unmistakable left facing dihedral a hundred yards south of the short section of the Textbooks. This route is the right side of the roof above the dihedral.

# Protection
If your a seasoned trad climber, you'll find the protection quit adequate. If your new to the trad game, you might be a little spooked by this climb, gear wise. Don't expect much for a top rope anchor. I wouldn't trust the lone bolt up there either. You'll figure out something.
