# Description
Simple but fun moves lead to an unmistakable off-width. Heave and ho for all of ten feet till you reach the top.

# Location
the far right route on that section of rock just before you have to hike around a mid sized pillar.

# Protection
Guide book says gear to 4" but I was able to use a 5" piece too. Build an anchor at the top.
