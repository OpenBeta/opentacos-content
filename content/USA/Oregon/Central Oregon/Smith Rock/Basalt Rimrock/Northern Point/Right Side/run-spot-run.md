# Description
This route has a smooth start with reasonable pro that goes over a small roof to a ledge that finishes straight up to anchors. Don't expect much good gear for the last 15 feet.

# Location
Right of Handyman above a wide crack in the middle of a huge bouldery block. Look for a dihedral peppered with chalk on loose blocks with a small roof.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5 inches.
