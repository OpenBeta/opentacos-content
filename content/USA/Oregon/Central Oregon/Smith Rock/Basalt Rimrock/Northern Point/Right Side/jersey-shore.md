# Description
This is the first route with a bolt anchor up top.

Climb easy moves to a bulge, and either go left (5.5) or go right on fun moves through a flare (5.8). Once on the bulge, pull a couple cruxy finger locks to the anchors.

# Location
Find the first bolt anchor after coming down the 5th class approach in the middle. About 15' left of a 3 bolt 5.12b called Insulation Arete, and the next route left from Lean Cuisine.

# Protection
gear to 2.5".
