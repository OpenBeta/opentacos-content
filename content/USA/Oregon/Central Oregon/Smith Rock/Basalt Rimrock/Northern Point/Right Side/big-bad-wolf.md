# Description
A cool awkward flairing crack with a fun finishing mini-roof. The route does have a bit of lichin on the last 15 feet or so but not more than can be handled.

# Location
The crack directly to the left of Microcosm. The lower portion of the crack flairs pretty wide with a slight lean to the right.

# Protection
Gear to 3'.
