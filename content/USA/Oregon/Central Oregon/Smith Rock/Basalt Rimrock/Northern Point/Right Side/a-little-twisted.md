This route was listed in the guidebook as a sport line. The bolts have been removed leaving it a fun short Top Rope.

Small hands and feet go up to a small ledge three-fourths the way up. finish with some insecure stemming with little for the fingers to latch on to.

# Location
The left side of the column where handyman sits. a fairly blank slabby boulder sits at the base.

# Protection
TR. Not sport anymore.
