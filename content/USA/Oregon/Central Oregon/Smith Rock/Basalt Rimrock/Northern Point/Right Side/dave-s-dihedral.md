# Description
This is the obvious inside corner just right of Insulation Arete, and  the two routes make a nice little pair of shorties. The crux move on this one is way stranger though, and will reward some thinking. This one took much more effort to do for me, though it's rated easier than its neighbor.

This is really a sport route, as the parts that matter are bolt protected, and some people may not even feel the need to place gear on the much easier upper half, though a leader would surely deck if they did fall up there without placing anything. I think I placed two cams, and made it super duper safe.

# Location
Obvious inside corner right of Insulation Arete, insanely short.

# Protection
A couple of medium size pieces for the top half.
