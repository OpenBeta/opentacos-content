# Description
This route is probably the most climbed route at the northern point with it's easy access and beginner friendly climbing. Kids seem to love it. If being lead, it protects well with a little blamk section in the middle. I protected the middle with a #1 C3 in a finger pocket.

# Location
Look for the obvious gully splitting the wall in the middle of the right side of northern point. The route starts on the right of the weakness.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5"
