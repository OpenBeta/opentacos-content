# Description
This burly route is the hardest in the center Northern Point area, and is pretty bouldery.

Start below a roof, with two hands on a good edge. From there, burly move after burly move takes you up the arete, to some thin crimps and more burly moves, onto a ledge and an easier trad finish to the anchor.

# Location
once down the 5th class downclimb to the cliff, look for the first bolted line on the west side, with 3 bolts above a small roof about 10' off the ground.

# Protection
3 bolts and optional gear to 2". If you made it to the trad section though, you shouldn't have an issue getting to the anchor.
