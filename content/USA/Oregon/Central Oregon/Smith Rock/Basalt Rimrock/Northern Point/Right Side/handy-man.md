# Description
An excellent moderate introduction to basalt crack climbing. The crux are the final moves. Easily top roped but you will need to get to the nearly hidden anchors that are just over the edge of the cliff.

# Location
Near the end of the rimrock. An obvious basalt dihedral crack about 40 feet left of Pumpkin Patch.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5 inches. Two bolt anchor.
