# Description
This route would be a hard onsight for most normal climbers. With a wierd first clip and a short but perplexing crux with streneuous clips on the way, don't expect this to be a simple give me. it's def not. The Crux comes at the first and second bolt with some insecure feet to an ugly offset. things ease up high in terms of strength but get a little delicate.

# Location
The first route with bolts if you come in from the far right.

# Protection
Bolts, Anchor.
