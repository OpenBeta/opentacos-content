# Description
This short route revolves around a powerful sequence into, and out of, an oblong pocket.

Try to conserve energy through the awkward and semi-difficult moves low. You will want to feel fresh coming into the crux. . .

After sticking the crux throw, make a difficult clip and crank up onto the ledges using solid holds. Simple, but unprotected climbing will take your through the last 15 feet to the anchor.

# Location
Two bolt lines left of the Heathen.

# Protection
6 bolts
