# Description
A wicked little route towards the far left of the area.  Very powerful moves and a steep pocket crux make for a stiff climb overall.  The second to last bolt is placed in such a way that it's an extremely burly clip.

I thought it was a little tougher than .13a, but due to its short height it may be accurate.  Very bouldery.

Stick clip the first bolt.

# Location
