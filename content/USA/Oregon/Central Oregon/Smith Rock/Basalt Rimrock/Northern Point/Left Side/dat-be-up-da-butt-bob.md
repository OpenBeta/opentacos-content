# Description
To the right of Lamoidian Power Dance is a sport route with cold shuts.  Begin by using the crack of Hang it Loose and clipping bolts to your right.  Once you clip the second bolt move into the traversing crimpy crux.  It's over quickly and you move into fun larger moves on bigger holds.  Quite unsustained but fun nonetheless.

# Location
Sport route between Lamoidian Power dance and Limbo

# Protection
5 bolts
