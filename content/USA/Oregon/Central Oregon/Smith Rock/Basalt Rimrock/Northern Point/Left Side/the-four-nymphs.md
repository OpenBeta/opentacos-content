# Description
A worthy Northern Point route.  Begin off the boulder and make some balancy moves on the slab.  Follow good holds for a while to a crux in the middle of the route on small edges, pockets, sidepulls, and slopers to an engaging finish that you keeps you on your toes to the anchor.

# Location
Far left side of the Northern point. Begins on a large boulder and shares first couple bolts with Flower Power

# Protection
6 bolts and fixed anchor
