# Description
Fun moves on big holds with good feet.  This is the most popular and the best 5.11 at the point.  Expect nice flow and a fun crux that is made much easier with good technique.

# Location
The most heavily chalked route at the point.  Once into the main area, Woman in the Meadow is the nice looking line on the far right side.  Look for big holds at the start, and a semi-high first bolt (don't worry, it's not bad getting there).

# Protection
A few bolts.
