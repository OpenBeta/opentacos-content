# Description
Although short, this route brings another unique experience on Smith basalt. Start with a fun flake, move up and left to some shattered jugs, then cut right on a small rail to the rounded ar√©te. Make a couple big moves on good holds and get set up to finish on a pocketed slab.

# Location
This is the bolt line just left of The Four Nymphs.

# Protection
Bolts and a fixed anchor.
