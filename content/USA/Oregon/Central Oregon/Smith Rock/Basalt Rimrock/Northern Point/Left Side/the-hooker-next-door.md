# Description
Following the bolt line up the bulge directly to the right of "Woman in the Meadow", this climb starts with a hard and somewhat awkward boulder problem, which goes from the ground to around the first bolt. After clipping the second bolt, the climbing eases by at least a number grade for a fairly straightforward climb up to the anchors of "Woman in the Meadow", with which this climb shares the last bolt.

# Location
In the main area on the left side of Northern Point, this route starts on a short, overhung arÃªte on the far right side of the sport climbing. Look for some heavily chalked right hand sidepull/undercling features, with a dihedral above. Alternately: immediately to the right of "Woman in the Meadow", with which this climb shares a finish. Not in the Watts guide.

# Protection
Five bolts plus anchors. Shares an anchor with "Woman in the Meadow."
