# Description
The hardest line at Northern Point! This is a linkup of Made in the Rain and The Heathen, connecting the crux of both routes back to back with no rest.

Short, bouldery, and incredibly resistant.

Recommend using a triple draw at the last bolt on the lip of the roof.

# Location
Climb the first 3 bolts of Made in the Rain (including the shared first bolt), keep right below the roof, and finish by climbing the last bolt of The Heathen.

# Protection
Bolts, recommend stick clipping the first bolt of The Heathen.
