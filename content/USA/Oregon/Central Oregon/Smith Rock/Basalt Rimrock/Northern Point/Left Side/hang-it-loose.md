# Description
Just left of 'Dat be up the butt Bob' is a fun gear route and one of the first routes put up at the Northern Point. Stem up the crack to the prominent roof then jam and pull through super fun holds to a rest cave. Clip the bolt protecting the crux and work your magic through a tricky and reachy sequence of moves. The climbing eases up top. The addition of the crux bolt has taken away the original R rating.
