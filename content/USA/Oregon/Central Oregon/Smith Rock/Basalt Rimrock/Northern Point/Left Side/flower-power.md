# Description
20 m feet upriver from Torrid Zone, Flower Power starts on the arete off the large block and then cuts right through fractured rock and up the corner.

# Location
Northern Point

this is not in the classic book

# Protection
5 bolts & sharing the first with a route that ascends direct. Flower power jags right to a 15 ft 2nd bolt and right to the third bolt...then up through the last few moves to a set of bolt anchors.
