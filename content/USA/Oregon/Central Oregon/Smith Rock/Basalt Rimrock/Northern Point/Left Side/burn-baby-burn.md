# Description
This short route provides a pump.  Start up a detached flake to an obvious roof, with a couple good stances between stemming and jamming thru to the exit moves, which continue in the 5.10 range.  Most everyone topropes this one from the two anchors on top the rim.

# Location
From the ramp that leads down to N. Point, head right (climber's left) just around the first corner, past the downed tree.

# Protection
Room for just a couple pieces, but you just gotta go...
