# Description
This is a really unique route, definitely worth checking out. It also feels like a bit of a sandbag at 12d.

There are likely a few ways to go about it, but the method I found climbs like a comp boulder. I recommend bringing a kneepad and some shoes with some rubber on top.

# Location
Just left of The Heathen.

Start up the easy corner on cool jugs to a steep layback feature.

The route shares holds with The Heathen just below the roof, then cuts hard left and turns the corner.

The jaunt to the chains is easy but keep a good head.

# Protection
Bolts, recommend stick clipping the first bolt of The Heathen.
