# Description
Climb up an easy flake, then lieback or jam through a roof and fist-crack. Beach yourself on the bulge using a big ledge and then enjoy easy climbing to the anchors. A little awkward but worth doing.

# Location
Line starting at the large left-leaning flake which is right of Woman in the Meadow.

# Protection
The bottom 2/3 could be easily protected with gear. Has 2 hangers up top for a TR anchor.
