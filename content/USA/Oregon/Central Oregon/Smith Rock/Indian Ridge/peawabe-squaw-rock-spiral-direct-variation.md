# Description
This route follows the two obvious cracks to the top of Peawabe Â (also known as squaw rock). While the climbing is probably more difficult than the spiral route (I haven't done the spiral) there is good pro for the majority of the route with the only truly X rated section being the last 15 feet or so.

There is a bolted anchor at the top (just hangers, no chains). A 70m rope will get you within 10' of the bottom (tie knotts) if you rap just left of the route from there downclimbing is pretty easy. Watch for rocks as you pull your rope.

# Location
Starts on the obvious ~25' crack on the uphill side of the hitchikers thumb. See approach betta on the Indian ridge page

# Protection
protects well with a single rack, bring some extra nuts in the 4-6 size range if you really want to sew it up. Long slings are very useful.
