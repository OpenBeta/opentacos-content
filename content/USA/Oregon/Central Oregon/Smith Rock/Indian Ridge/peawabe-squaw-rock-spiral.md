# Description
This classic adventure route makes for an excellent solo.  The route begins on the South (or Smith Rock) side of the tower with a short boulder problem right off the deck to surmount the large sloping ramp that is the base of Squaw Rock.  There are numerous places that you can scramble on to this ramp, so pick a spot that inspires you.  Once on the ramp, head up (to the right or north), and begin spiraling around the tower in a counter-clockwise fashion.  The difficulty is never greater than third class.  Enjoy the views and reverse the route.

# Location
Begins on the S side of Squaw Rock, the most prominent formation on Indian Ridge.

# Protection
None.
