# Description
This route starts on a short slab then makes its way into less than desirable rock with bolted protection. Just after the last bolt comes the crux moves. continue up and right to the anchors at the top. Can be done in a single pitch. The crux is really trying to avoid smashing your belayer with raining rockfall. Double rope rape to the ground on the north side.

# Location
This route starts on the upper northwest corner. Look for the only line of bolts on the formation. Remember that it is mixed.

# Protection
Mixed to 2". Rap anchors on top only. Double rope rap recommended.
