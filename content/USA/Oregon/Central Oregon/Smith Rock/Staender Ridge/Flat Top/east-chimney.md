# Description
Take the ramp up the downhill side of Flat Top to gain access to the chimney.  Rock quality in the chimney is close to perfect, with only a couple spots of obvious crumbly rock that are easily avoided. Very short rap off the west side to descend.  Rap rings on both anchors if I recall correctly.

Great views of the park make the hike worth it, assuming minimally protected chimneys are your thing.

# Location
Obvious chimney on Flat Top.

# Protection
There is a project out to the Northeast of the chimney that you can clip a couple alpine draws to.  Other than that, some giant big bros are about all that could protect you.  Anchors at the plateau, and at the summit.
