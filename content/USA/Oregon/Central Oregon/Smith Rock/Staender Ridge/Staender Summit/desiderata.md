# Description
The finger-locks on this route are some of the best in the park. There is about 15 feet of scrambling the about 40 feet of great rock and perfect fingers, then a wierd and low quality off-width bulge to deal with for another 10 feet or so. I actually thought the off-with at the top added character to this already excellent route. This route combined wioth several others will make your walk well worth it.

# Location
on the east side of the wall. look for the obvious crack with higher quality rock than the rest around.

# Protection
Pro to 4" however a #5 c4 would be nice at the off-width. Doubles in smaller sizes or a double set of nuts. Anchors. NO CHAINS. you'll need to top belay any parties wanting to second this.
