# Description
Upon arriving at Adit Rock you'll be directly under the steep arÃªte that is Anti-Reflective.  Hop on top of the pillar, clip the first bolt and get ready to do battle.  You'll get a few quick shakes on the route but never anything like a rest until clipping the anchor.  This is a good one to project as the falls are clean and the bolts are tightly spaced.  Speaking of bolts, several of them are surprisingly tiring to clip.
