# Description
Climb the wide crack/chimney that splits the face from top to bottom.

Climbing the offwidth top section can be avoided by climbing on face hold to the right of the crack.

# Location
Obvious crack to the right of the giant leaning flake

# Protection
Standard rack to 5 inches.  You need big gear to protect the top, which is also probably the crux of the route.
