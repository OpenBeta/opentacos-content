# Description
Shockingly fun for a 5.4 on Staender Ridge.  Great rock, good movement.  If you were interested in a couple of other routes near Adit Rock, and were looking for something different, this could be a great excuse for a diversion from the typical day at Smith.  Use this route and a couple others as a good first day of the season, or a nice place to go when you're injured, and still want to climb.

# Location
Find Adit Rock - the closest large formation to the river on Staender Ridge.  Tread as lightly as possible on the trail up, erosion could become an issue here.

You'll know the route because it's riddled with attractive pockets, it faces the river, its low angle, and it has fresh bolts on it.  It's around to the right when you look up at the rock from the river, near the great looking sharp arete and a funny little 5.7 slab.

# Protection
Bolts.
