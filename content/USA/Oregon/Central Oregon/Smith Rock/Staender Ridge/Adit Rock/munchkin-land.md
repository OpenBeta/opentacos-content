# Description
As the name suggests, this route is short but what it lacks in height it more than makes up for in easy fun and sometimes awkward moves along this corner crack climb. The crux would depend on your style.

# Location
look for the obvious crack on the left side of the big roof. it looks more intimidating than it actually is.

# Protection
Pro to 3". Anchors on your right at the roof.
