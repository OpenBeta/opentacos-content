# Description
This route was given two stars in the guide book but I decided to bump it up on here. The gear is truly unique, and the climbing is truly awkward. the crux is everything This route used to be bolted along the outside of the bombay crack but has since been chopped. The only way to do it now is to either set up nice guy's and top rope the outside edge of the crack or go all out and lead it from inside the depths of this gaping crack. The lead is awesome. My only complaint was the length. so short.

# Location
look for the 20' bombay crack on the left side of adit rock. Not too hard to find.

# Protection
Pro to 4". I would say that a 4" or 5" piece would be nice. This is one of the few Routes I've ever climbed that took Hexes better than any other piece I own. The crack has a wierd shape that you can slide hexes along with you as you treverse the cave. Anchors are same as Nice Guy's. Rap.
