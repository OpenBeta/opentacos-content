# Description
Easy face (5.3?) with 3 closely spaced bolts to a ledge.  A few final moves move past a bulge, protected by a fourth bolt that comprises the crux (5.5?). These final moves are fun and interesting once you get the sequence down and make this short route somewhat worth doing.

# Location
Route is 10 ft left of Instant Replay.

# Protection
4 bolts to a fixed anchor.
