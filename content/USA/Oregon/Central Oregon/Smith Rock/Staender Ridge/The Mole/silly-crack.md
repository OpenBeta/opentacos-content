# Description
This is listed as a trad route but is more of a boulder problem with a scramble. Start with a short roof crack hand jam that lasts all of two moves then your pretty much done. Continue all the way up the face until you reach the top.

# Location
look on the uphill side of the mole for a low roof crack and sloping ground beneath.

# Protection
Pro to 3". anchors are all the way over the other side of the summit.
