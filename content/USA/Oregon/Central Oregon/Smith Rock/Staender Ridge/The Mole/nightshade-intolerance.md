# Description
This route is deceptively hard. We stayed mostly right of the bolts. after the first clip. the first clip is the crux and it eases as you move higher.

# Location
The bolt line right beside chopper to the right.

# Protection
3 bolts. Anchors. It is a little runout to the chains but easy climbing.
