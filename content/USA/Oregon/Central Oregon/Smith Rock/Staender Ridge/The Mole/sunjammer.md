# Description
Two pitch exposure on the first pitch!  Make an airy traverse to the base of the dihedral and then battle up the route using the thin crack for holds and protection. This is a superb route that is seldom climbed due to the distance from the parking lot.

# Location
The obvious right-facing dihedral on the west face of The Mole.

# Protection
Gear to 1 inch.
