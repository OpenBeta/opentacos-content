# Description
This route follows the interesting natural seam on the face. Start the route on the right side of the overhang (a bit chossy till the first bolt, then it gets better). After clipping the third bolt, you bust out left onto the face following the diagonal rail. Cruxy several moves between 4th and 6th bolts. After the 7th bolt you can clip the anchor from a good stance. There's an extension (two more bolts) to the top of the formation goes at 5.9 but not recommended for the rope drag.

# Location
This route is located on the west side of the Mole, just left of Sunjummer crack. In fact the bottom part of this route can link up to Sunjummer as a direct off-width start option from the west side of the formation.

# Protection
7 Glue-in bolts + Anchor (2 more bolts and anchor for the extension to the top)
