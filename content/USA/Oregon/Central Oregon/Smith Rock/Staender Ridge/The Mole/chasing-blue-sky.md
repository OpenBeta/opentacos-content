# Description
This route is deserving of the start rating for the crux alone. Start on simple face climbing until you reach a ledge and the route turns left onto a scoop shaped overhang. enjoy delicate moves around the arete and charge upward toward the anchors. The rock is pretty good but a few holds move a little after the crux.

# Location
This bolt line sits on the uphill wall in the massive corridor. around the left corner of chopper.

# Protection
5 bolts. Anchors.
