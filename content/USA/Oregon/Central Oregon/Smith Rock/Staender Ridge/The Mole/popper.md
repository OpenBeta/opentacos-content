# Description
Good stances and closely spaced bolts make this a good intro to the grade. The crux comes low as most smith rock routes do, and eases a little to the anchors.

# Location
Look for the small dihedral to the right of chopper and nightshade. It goes directly up the corner.

# Protection
6 Bolts. Anchors with chains.
