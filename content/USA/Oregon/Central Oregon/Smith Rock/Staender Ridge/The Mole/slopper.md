# Description
This is one wierd route. the gear is questionable and the crux move to get out of the flair is so so awkward. enjoy this problem solver.

# Location
The large flairing crack boulder problem to the left of popper.

# Protection
Pro to 1". Follow the slab above the real climbing to the same anchors as popper. It's runout but easy.
