# Description
An excellent yet neglected multi pitch crack route in the main area.

Pitch 1: 10.b

Start in the same corner system as Calamity Jam but climb out the right side of the bulge via a thin crack. The crack widens to hands above but stays on you for a ways. Move right to a bolted belay.

Pitch 2: 5.9

Some people break this into two pitches with a gear anchor if topping out.

From the bolted belay move up the corner above for about 12 feet before moving left into a different crack which splits the face to the left. Diagonal up and left in a nice crack for quite a ways (5.8)before it eases off and either belay or head up into the short but steep corner system (5.9) and belay at a bolted anchor (awkward belay).

Rap the route or Calamity Jam with a 60m or escape by traversing right and rap Cinnamon Slab.

# Location
Right of Calamity Jam, Left of Friday's Jinx
