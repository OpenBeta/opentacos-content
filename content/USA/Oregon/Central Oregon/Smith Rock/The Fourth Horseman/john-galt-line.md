A few pocket/edge moves lead to some challenging moves involving long reaches between good edges. Near the top, a tricky section pulling though a small bulge on pockets and edges leads to an easy finish.

# Location
Just right of Pack Animal Direct (trad dihedral).

# Protection
Bolts.  Rap Anchor.
