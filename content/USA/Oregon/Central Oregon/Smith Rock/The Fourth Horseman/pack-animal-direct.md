# Description
Pack Animal Direct offers a harder option for Pack Animal pitch 1 (Pack Animal is a 2-pitch 5.8 trad line on the Four Horsemen).  It is listed in the guidebook as a separate route.

Look for a 30-foot, right-facing dihedral capped by a small roof (it's on the face just right of Headless Horseman).  Dihedral starts about 10 feet above ground.

Scramble up to base of dihedral (c. 5.7).  Stem your way up the clean corner.  There's an intermittent crack in corner (improves a bit higher up) but it's THIN (tips for most).  At top, step left just below the roof to a bolted anchor atop pitch 1 of Pack Animal.  The route felt hard for the grade.
