# Description
Ascend the protectable crack (5.5) then make a tricky traverse to an old fixed pin.  Another tricky move to easier moves to a small ledge belay. The second pitch follows the sweet right-facing dihedral past a small roof (5.8) to the top.

# Location
On the Fourth Horseman next to Pack Animal Direct.

# Protection
Gear to 2.5 inches.
