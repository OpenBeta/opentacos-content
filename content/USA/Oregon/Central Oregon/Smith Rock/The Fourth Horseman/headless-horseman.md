# Description
A fun route with good position on the Third Horseman, which is adjacent to the tallest tower just to a climber's right.

Starting with a step off of a bolted belay onto the face it meanders up good rock with consistent and fun 5.10+ climbing.  The bolts are spaced pretty well, which makes for some spicy moves once you start moving around the aretes.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
10 bolts to a bolted anchor
