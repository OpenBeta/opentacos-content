# Description
A honey comb start crux. Got that?  Might want a stick clip for the first bolt, the move is typical of smith climbing being bouldery for the first couple moves.  After pulling through the second bolt, positive edges on crappy rock bring you to a ledge with anchors.  Good if you need to send a 10a or you really have nothing else to do.

# Location
Tuff It Out is located on the 4th horseman wall up the small hill and to the left of the Peanut.  This route is clearly identified by the honey-comb pockets at the start.

# Protection
Bolts. Has its own anchors
