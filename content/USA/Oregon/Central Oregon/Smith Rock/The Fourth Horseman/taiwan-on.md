# Description
Taiwan On tackles the arete just left of Pack Animal Direct.  Viewed from the base of Pack Animal and nearby routes the arete is dramatic feature, and looks incredibly sharp.  The climb starts up the vertical face on the right side of the arete.  Swing around to the left side when you run out of features, then back to the right side a little higher.  Transitioning from one side to the other can be tricky.  The crux comes near the top of the face, connecting crimps to pull onto the slab above the face before an easier run to the anchor.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Vertical bolts connected by one chain with one rap ring on the lower bolt for anchor.
