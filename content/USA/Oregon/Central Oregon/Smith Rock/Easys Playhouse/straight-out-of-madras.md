# Description
Create a Large step ladder out of rocks and jump up to two slopers as start holds.  Move yourself along slopers to the second clip.  Then, here comes the crux.  Pull a double Gaston on two shitty slopers holding yourself by body pressure, and then shoot your left hand up two feet to a undergoing crimp gaston, and then push up into it (5.12b crux).  Then right into the second crux either dyno or a ridiculous static move off of a very small crimp.  Don't lose it, traverse into jugs just left of Big Boss Man.

# Location
