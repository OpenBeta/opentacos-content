# Description
Pretty chossy and neglected, but it has some descent climbing on it. I climbed direct to the 3rd bolt and clipped, then backed off a move and cut hard right to the blunt arete. Still 12a that way for sure.

Get ready to be brave at the top, it's pretty dirty and hard to find the holds.

We hiked around to the top and rapped off a tree to clean it.

# Location
First route right of 'Bugging Out', just in front of the tree. The infamous bee's nest is gone.

# Protection
3 bolts plus anchors
