# Description
Two cruxes, one down low from the 3rd bolt to the 4th bolt(5.12-)Dyno. Then a ok rest for the next clip, then, 5 crazy hard moves making for the ultamate crux and also the red point crux(5.12+).  Crazy tension leads you to a 7 foot chimney and then you have sent.

# Location
Right of the crack.  The route just right of boys in the hood.

# Protection
5 bolts then the anchor.  The second bolt has two because one of them is bad.  Put a two foot  extention on the 5th.
