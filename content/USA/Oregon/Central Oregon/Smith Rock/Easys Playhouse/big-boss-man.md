# Description
The second easiest route in the playhouse. Begin on stack of rocks to good incut holds. Follow up a series of goods jugs to an interesting cross move. Clip the 3rd bolt and one 5.10 await you and your redpoint attempt.

Recently (Oct 2005) the first bolt on this line blew out. However, the second can be stick clipped.

# Location
First route to the left of the 11d

# Protection
5 bolts to a 2 bolt rap anchor
