# Description
This is another basalt ultra-classic that mysteriously receives a sandbag split-grade in the guidebook.  As if there were any doubt this was at least 12d!  Unless you're a honed basalt master, this will probably feel like 5.13.  Perhaps the sandbag is due to the fact that the route is relatively easy most of the way, with a sinister double crux between the 3rd & 4th bolts.

# Location
Red Columns, the next "outy" left of Big Tuna

# Protection
Bolts.  This route is the most runout in the Upper Gorge.  Consider TR rehearsal, or hanging double-length slings off the 4th and 5th bolts so you can clip before executing the cruxes.
