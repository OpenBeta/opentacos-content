# Description
I'm noting the approach gully here as an organizational aide; it breaks the Upper Gorge into two sections. The Urge and Shark Infested Waters, etc, are all downstream to the west.  The Seep, E-Type, and Mojomatic etc. are all upstream to the east.

Depending on water levels and how overgrown the base is, dropping in here it may be the best and/or only approach.

# Location
A climber trail leads from the canal road to the top of the gully but if you've never located it before, you can also find it by hiking the rim of the Gorge eastward from the bend in the river.  It's the first and only break in this section of the gorge.

# Protection
easy scramble, but slipping could be bad
