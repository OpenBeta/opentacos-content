# Description
A very good sport route, Tomb of Love has some great movement.  The crux is a mix of stems and finger sized slots, and if you get through that you will be rewarded with a very fun pull around the roof.  Shares anchors with Hot Lava, the original 5.13 of the Upper Gorge.

# Location
In Middle Earth Crag, just left of a very large bush, in between the E-Type area and Naxis area.

# Protection
10 bolts & chains
