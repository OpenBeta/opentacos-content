# Description
Pretty much the only column joint wide enough to crack climb in this section of the Upper.  A superb and physically demanding old school crack splits a sea of modern face climbs.

# Location
Immediately left of the prominant 'outie' column The Urge.

# Protection
Protects perfectly a la any of the classic Lower Gorge 5.10s
