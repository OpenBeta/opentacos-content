# Description
Start in a little alcove just to the right of the E Type start.  After getting established a tricky palming move gets you to some good crack holds. Good luck trying to fit your right hands into the crack, and holding on to the arete on the left.  A fun crank from the ringlock crack to a good hold gives you a little respite. The second crux is more of the same, tiiny holds in the crack and ripples around the corner.  Then, without any respite, set up for a big deadpoint.

Like the Urge, expect this to feel plenty hard for the grade.  Its worth noting that pretty much all of Frizzel's testpeice's  in this grade range have been upgraded.

# Location
The first bolted line upstream (right) of E-Type Jag.  You can set up a top rope by climbing E Type, then moving right to the 11d top rope anchors (5th Dimension),then swinging right on the way down.

# Protection
8 bolts, anchors
