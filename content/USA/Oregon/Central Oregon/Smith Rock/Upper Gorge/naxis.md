# Description
One of the best moderate sport lines on Basalt in Smith.  Start by soloing a little pedestal, clip a bolt and enjoy the fun sequences, stem, crimp, jug, repeat!  You can top rope 4 5.12s off this route too!  At the top you can go up/right or left.

# Location
After passing the bucket arete of E-Type Jag, this is the next heavily chalked route, it has a moderate clearing underneath and starts with a 20 foot pillar, above this is the stemming box of Naxis.
