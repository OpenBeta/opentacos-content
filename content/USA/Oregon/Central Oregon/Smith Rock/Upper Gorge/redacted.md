# Description
This stellar arete climb is likely the most attainable of the Upper Gorge 5.13s.  If you're looking to round-out your resume with something hard from the Upper Gorge, this is the route for you.  With five known ascents, this is by far the most popular 5.13 in the gorge, and is only slightly harder than The Urge, but less technical.

# Location
This route is in "Middle Earth", near the far up-stream end of the Upper Gorge.  Feminazis is the prominent prow just upstream from the large roofs of Blame it on Rio and Peruvian Skies.

# Protection
