# Description
Yellow Fin may look a little scrappy at first glance, but closer inspection reveals a true gem. The rock is mostly great, the movement wonderfully varied, and the position wild.

After a brief stint on straightforward holds at the bottom, you're quickly forced into compression between the two aretes. I'm 5'9" with a plus 2 and was just able to make the spans.  This section would be harder and likely more frustrating with a much shorter reach  After an optional shake around to the right, wrestle through a few more bolts of compression before a wild palming sequence to get established in the hanging corner.  Quickly turn the arete to the right and surf up fun in-cuts to the final roof looming above.  Execute a wild hanging mantle onto the slab  and crimp your way to chains and glory up and to the right.

# Location
Look for the hanging column halfway up the cliff with the second roof above it.  Yellow Fin is is the 3rd bolted line downstream of Colorsplash (the only trad climb in the immediate vicininty) and just downstream from the large column/bench at the base of the wall.
