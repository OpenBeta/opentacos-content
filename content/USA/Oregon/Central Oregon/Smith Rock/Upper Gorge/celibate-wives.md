# Description
A fun "innie", Celibate Wives gets going right off the ground.  The real crux hits around the 4th bolt with multiple ways to attack the tough moves.  Commit to going left or right then you're rewarded with a great rest.  From here there is one more semi-crux sequence guarding the last bolt, but the challenge is from holding it all together.

# Location
2 routes right of the striking arete "Mojomatic" towards the far right of the crag

# Protection
7 or 8 bolts
