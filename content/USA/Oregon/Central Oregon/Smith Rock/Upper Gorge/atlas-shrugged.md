# Description
“My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.”

— Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged

Atlas Shrugged is another phenomenal climb in the Upper Gorge.  Overlooked in the initial Upper Gorge exploration, it links distant liebacks, underclings, and arete holds with improbable stems.  The business hits in the first 4 bolts, with some awesome technical & bouldery moves.

If you pass that you get a poor shake, and then straight into more hard climbing (12- to the top).

# Location
Downriver in the Red Columns, the fourth to last route with a brief section of exfoliating rock near the start.  Easily access to anchors stepping right from Almost Something.

# Protection
9 bolts and modern hardware
