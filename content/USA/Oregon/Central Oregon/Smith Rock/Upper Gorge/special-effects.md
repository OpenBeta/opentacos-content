# Description
Another engaging sport climb in the Upper Gorge.  Tricky movement from bottom to top, but the meat of the climbing is in the middle as you pass through stems, liebacks, and steeper moves.

Initially this climb ended before pulling the overhang, but early on it was routed up and left.  The finish isn’t the hardest section, with big holds behind a block that seems very nebulously attached to the rest of the cliff.  This anchor is also hard to clean from. I balked here the second time I tried but my friend Forrest kicked the block on rappel and it seemed solid. If you’d like to finish the original method, traverse over to the Urge/Color Splash anchor.
