# Description
Amazing stemming...long reaches between good holds.

The moves are well protected by bolts and fun. A good warm up for Upper Gorge climbers, a good project for mortals.

Being tall helps on this route as the stems in this shallow stem box are wide and the reaches are long.

# Location
Middle Earth, upstream from E Type Jag a couple hundred yards.

# Protection
