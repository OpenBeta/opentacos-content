# Description
This is a fun stemming problem a few climbs down from E-Type Jag.  It's a little crumbly because of so few ascents but would clean up nicely if the Upper Gorge saw more traffic.

# Location
This is the obvious stem box 5 climbs down from E-Type.

# Protection
There are 7 bolts but a few aliens would sew up the run out to the anchor.  As is, the bolting job is pretty poor with the crux coming after the climbs only run-out.
