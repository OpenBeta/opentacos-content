# Description
Quite well featured face climbing by gorge standards.  The '92 guidebook suggests that it is often wet or dirty due to a seep in the leaky canal, but this has not been a problem. Not a classic but it would be popular in a more heavily visited area.

# Location
Probably the third bolted line east (upstream) of the approach gully.  Big holds on weathered but solid rock.

# Protection
bolts
