# Description
The West Chimney is very serious and dangerous as almost every move is done on insecure rock. With that being said, It is a worth while climb for anyone who has spent time at smith and past by that dominating landmark on there way to the classics in the park time after time. To the best of my knowledge, it only sees an ascent every five to seven years or so.

# Location
up the shipwreck gully where the rhyolite meets the tuff.

# Protection
Gear to 4" worked for us although the Alan Watts guide book says 3". Don't expect many pieces to be reliable, just psychological.
