# Description
Trash Can Crack (aka The Paul Jantzi Memorial Route) climbs the obvious wide crack/corner to summit the west face of Smith's most appalling pile of choss.

P1. Climb a decaying ramp up and right on dreadful rock into the corner. Work up through a series of crust-filled wide cracks, stem and chimney moves to a ledge. (~150ft)

P2. Step left to the face on mossy feet and up into the crux of the route. Traverse back right on crumbling rot to regain the corner and climb to a comfortable ledge. Smoke a cigarette. (~60ft)

P3. The money pitch. Romp up the remaining grassy ledge and head up the disintegrating face to summit. Savor the excellent position and most reasonable protection on the entire trash can and proceed to thank whoever you prayed to as you sling the tatted crown. (~40ft)

# Location
West side of Ship Rock.

# Protection
Gear to 5" garbage. Double rope rappel.
