# Description
Quite different from the usual 12b at Smith. A powerful, overhanging, bouldery line. Begin up a short series of crimps and underclings to two good incut pockets. A powerful lockoff and pinch right where the overhangs characterizes the crux. An easy mantel follows. This is a very onsightable Smith 12b.

# Location
Half way up the left side of the Gully. Directly left of Cocaine crack and right of Quest to Fire. It is the most overhung route in the area.

# Protection
4 perma-draws to a two bolt anchor. Bring one draw - stick clip recommended. Clean first draw using perma-draw directional on lower.
