# Description
A classic 5.11 pump-a-thon.  A stick-clip is often used to clip the first bolt to protect the insecure and overhanging first moves.  The climbing is steep and consistent with a crux coming in the middle, but the pump will send many climbers for a ride near the top.

Vomit Launch is just to the left of the Cocaine Crack on the right wall in the Cocaine Gully, and starts under the small roof.
