# Description
This is a fun route with cool exposure and consistently fun climbing.  It starts with a rather steep boulder problem (a stick clip makes it seem much less difficult) and then goes straight up a slightly slabby face with lots of nubbins. If you like Smith Rock nubbin climbing, you will love this route.

This is the farthest right route on the right wall in the Cocaine Gully.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
9 bolts and a bolted anchor.  A stick clip is handy for protecting the bouldery bottom section before gaining the main face.
