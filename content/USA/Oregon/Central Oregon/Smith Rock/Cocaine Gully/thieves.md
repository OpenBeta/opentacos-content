# Description
This route acts more like a highball boulder problem than a sport route. Start up the dihedral and move right into the overhang of three finger pockets and jugs. After your second clip, start moving up through the crimpy crux. The route cruises after the fourth bolt. powerful but no real endurance needed for this quick tick.

# Location
The last route on the left side before a break in the cliff. It’s got a severe overhang at the start.

# Protection
Five bolts. Anchor with rings.
