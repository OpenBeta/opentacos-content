# Description
Spectacular position and excellent climbing. This is the top portion of the seldom done route ?Slit Your Wrists? (5.13b). Start on top of Skeleton Surfer. Stick clip the first bolt! Reach blindly out onto the face to find a great pocket, step across. Begin a series of funky arete moves for the first crux; considered somewhat beta-intensive. Highstep your way through the next crux and clip the anchors.

# Location
The exposed arete on the right side of Cocaine Gully.

# Protection
4 bolts, 2 bolt anchor. Stick clip is a must!
