# Description
A Smith classic with bomber, vertical stone and excellent climbing. After a mid height technical crux this route turns to sweet reaches between incut crimps.  The good climbing seems to go on forever!

# Location
Freebase starts just to the left of Vomit Lunch and up on a higher level.  Be careful at the belay ledge as it is easy to send rocks (or a person) down on to climbers below.  Stick clipping the first bolt is a very good idea (and I think stickclipping is usually kind of wimpy:).
