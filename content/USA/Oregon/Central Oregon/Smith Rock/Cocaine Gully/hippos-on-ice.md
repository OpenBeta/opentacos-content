# Description
This route will never get popular. The moves are forgettable pockets and nubbins on less than stellar rock with some distance between bolts. If you climb at the grade, your probably somewhere else.

# Location
Second route left of the 3rd class water groove on the left wall of cocain gully.

# Protection
3 bolts anchors w/ chains.
