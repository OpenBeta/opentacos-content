# Description
Start up a large left-facing flake. A thin crux sequence comes early on. After a quick shake at a flat jug, more thin edges and sloping pockets lead to the top. Short, but solid and worthwhile.

# Location
right wall, 3 routes up from Vomit Launch, just left of Powder up the Nose.

# Protection
5 bolts, rap rings
