# Description
Just uphill from Freebase, this route is great fun on little pinchers.  If you enjoyed Chicken McNuggets, you'll enjoy this one.  It's a nice test of strategic resting - bad rhythm will get you all pumped out.

Expect it to be pleasantly stiff for the grade.

# Location
if you're doing a powerful undercling to get to the first bolt (freebase), go uphill one route.

# Protection
