# Description
Head up the same start as Chicken McNuggets, clip one bolt and head into the crack. Plentiful but often gritty pro, but the climbing is secure and pleasant. Crux comes when you switch cracks.

# Location
Start is the same as Chicken McNuggets, ends on Vomit Launch.

# Protection
Pro to 2.5, offset nuts are nice, offset cams could be good too
