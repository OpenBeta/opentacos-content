# Description
An awkward layback (?) move above a big hueco leads to a jug, and then to the most painful, thin, flaring hand crack you've ever climbed. Maybe once was climbed on gear, but now it's fully bolted. The climbing eases off substantially after the 5.11 crux. The anchor is awkward to clip involving one last annoyingly difficult move to clip the carabiner. It's possible to hang a draw on the steely from beneath, although if you're a purist, you may not... Then again, if you're a purist you probably didn't clip the bolts either :)

This is one difficult climb.

If anyone has any more information on this route, please share!

# Location
It's the bolted overhung crack right of crack babies.

# Protection
9 bolts
