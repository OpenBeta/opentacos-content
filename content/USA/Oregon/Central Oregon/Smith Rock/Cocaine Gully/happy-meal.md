# Description
This technical knob climb is a fun new addition to the Right Cocaine Wall. Start with a large side pull/under cling feature and traverse left on small holds. The middle section is lower angle but still tricky, and the finish is steeper with fun holds. Some of the holds are improbable on this climb, but because it climbs through a water streak it is already solid.

From the anchor it is easy to swing right and set up the original Cocaine high line or set a TR on the Blade/Time's Up.

# Location
Just right of Chicken McNuggets, there is a belay bolt and a large flat rock to belay off of.

# Protection
12 bolts to fixed chains
