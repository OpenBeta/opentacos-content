# Description
This is a short one-move wonder route with a sharp, crimp sequence for the "wonder" part. Mantle onto a ledge and then tackle the tweaky crux above the second bolt. After this, it's easy to the anchors. Rated 11a in the 1992 Watt's guide, the single hard sequence perhaps lost a hold and increased the grade. Only one hard sequence, but more sustained than the .11’s

uphill.

# Location
Upper right (North) side of Cocaine Gully, just before the last two (newer-not in the Watt's guide) routes, Armageddon and Deep Impact.

# Protection
Bolts(aprox 4).  Bolt anchors.
