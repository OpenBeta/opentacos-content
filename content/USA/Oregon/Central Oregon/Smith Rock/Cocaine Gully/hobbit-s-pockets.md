# Description
Climb past steep pockets and face moves to an anchor

# Location
This route is located on the lower left side of Cocaine Gully, downhill from Crack Babies close to the gully chockstone. Look for pockets low on route. The climb to the left is .11b and may be loose.

Feel free to update information and I will modify as needed.

Thanks, Erik
