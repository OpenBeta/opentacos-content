# Description
This route is a one-sequence wonder that could be considered a bolted boulder problem.  Easy moves lead to a tricky sequence pulling around a bulge on big holds.  After this, easy arete moves lead to an anchor.  Enjoyable moves but the brief difficulties are all over 1/3rd of the way up.

# Location
Middle of Upper Pleasure Palace Wall, just left of

Bop Till You Drop

.

# Protection
five bolts, and the anchor at the top is hangers only (no rings or chains).
