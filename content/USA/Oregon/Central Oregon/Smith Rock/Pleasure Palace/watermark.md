# Description
This enjoyable line runs through very large nubbins (including one the size of a baseball) then switches over to small angled ledges and pockets running over a bulge or two. Using good feet will make this route feel easier than the grade.

# Location
The right most bolt line on the lower Pleasure Palace wall.

# Protection
6 bolts. Anchors on shared ledge with "Red Scare".
