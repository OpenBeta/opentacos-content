# Description
This route would probably be my last choice of climbs at Pleasure Palace. The start is a little interesting with a few thought provoking moves up a right leaning seam that peters out to mediocre face moves. This all leads up to the perfect ending of reaching up to a giant jug full of a huge pile of bird droppings. Mantle this and clip the anchors.

# Location
The left most line of bolts on the lower Pleasure Palace wall.

# Protection
5 bolts. Anchors at top. you won't be able to see the anchors from the base but the're there. You might wish they weren't though. Rap.
