# Description
This route has fairly forgettable moves but makes for a good warm up if your working the harder routes on the wall. lichen covers the upper section but constant traffic keeps the lichen of the hand and footholds. Keep moving upward and the bolts and anchors will appear. crux is after the third bolt.

# Location
the face to the right of Aggro Bumbly.

# Protection
4 bolts.
