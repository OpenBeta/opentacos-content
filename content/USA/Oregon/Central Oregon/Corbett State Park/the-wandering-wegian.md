# Description
The Crux is around 30' from the top.  It is an overhang lasting only around 10'.  You will know you have come to it when you reach a 45 degree clean slab (this in in of itself could be a crux move if you have too much rope drag).  I protected the near overhanging move with a BD #10 Hex.

It is hard to find solid placements the entire route (hence the R rating) as moss and lichen fill all of the cracks and must be scrapped out with a nut tool.

# Location
The wall is opposite the entrance into NF-2076 from Hwy 20, about 2 miles in; you can see it from across the valley as you drive in.  Continue down the dirt road until you reach a large boulder field to the west and south.  Once there hike in for about 1/4 mile until you reach the base of the 220' wall.

# Protection
Standard trad rack up to 3": cams, nuts, hexes, long slings to reduce rope drag.
