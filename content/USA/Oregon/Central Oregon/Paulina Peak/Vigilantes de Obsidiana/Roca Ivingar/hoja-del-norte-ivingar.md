# Description
Easiest route I could find up this rock.  Huge holds, no protection so bring trad gear!  The top is a slight overhang, but pretty easy overall, the entire climb is about 5.6, maybe even low 5th for certain portions.

# Location
Directly below that loose rock on the top.  Yeah I know sounds hella sketchy cause it is.  You only yolo once.

# Protection
NONE!!  BWAHAHA!  You can trad it though
