# Description
Head straight up the face following the flake-like edge around the cave with your hands. Top out is pretty high, but the rock had nice ledges and pockets, making this fun and comfortable despite the height.

# Location
Find this climb at the south end of the inner wall of the West Passage. Start below and left of high cave/pocket.

# Protection
no bolts, potential to top-rope off tree if you could figure out a directional with trad gear on the top.
