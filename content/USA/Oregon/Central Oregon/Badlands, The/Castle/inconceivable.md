# Description
Tricky moves off the ground and then 2/3's of the way up keeps the climbing interesting. Move onto the arete on your right 2/3 of the way up to keep the climbing more moderate, or stay in the middle of the face to tip-toe up small pockets and ledges.

# Location
This is just a bit south of the middle of the West Passage, on the inside wall.

# Protection
no bolts of anchor, bring a pad.
