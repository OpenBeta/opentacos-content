# Description
A small cave provides a few juggy, overhanging problems with a sandy landing. For Grayskull, start sitting right of the cave, and move up and left over the opening to top-out. Not many moves to this short climb, but entertaining if you're already at Castle for some climbing.

# Location
This little cave is right in the middle of the East Passage on the inside wall.

# Protection
no bolts or anchor. bring a pad.
