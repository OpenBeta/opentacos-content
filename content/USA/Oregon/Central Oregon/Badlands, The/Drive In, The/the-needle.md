# Description
Debatable 5.9, could almost be as low as 5.7 depending on who's grading. Â Going off of Mebbing's photograph it's 5.9, on the arete edge of the Varassic/Hot Pockets face, numerous holds, the crux is just below the top since you kind of have to balance your legs, but otherwise mist route is 5.7ish

# Location
Adjacent to Varassic and Hot Pockets on the Wall facing you as you walk into the Drive In.
