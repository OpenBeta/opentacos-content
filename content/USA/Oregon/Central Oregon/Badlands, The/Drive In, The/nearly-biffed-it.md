# Description
About one third of the way up the wall you will see a nice jug undercling. Start just below that, with your first move to the undercling, then begin to traverse right to the arete. Pinch the arete and use thin face holds, but stay right and avoid moving into the crack to your left. Head up to the large juggy slot and then finish on some easy ledges to top out. (Easy walkoff)

# Location
Center of the South Middle wall, directly in front of the North Chasm.

# Protection
Boulder pad
