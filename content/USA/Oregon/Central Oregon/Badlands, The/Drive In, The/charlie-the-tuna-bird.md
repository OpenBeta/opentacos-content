# Description
Start with a move or two of stemming with the rock to the right of this chunky arete and then move on up the isolated, narrow face of the arete. Fun, airy position mostly makes up for a bit of moss and the simplicity of the moves. Watch for one slightly loose hold 2/3 way up. *PG-13 due to inability for crash-pad to protect a fall much based on how near the adjacent rock faces are.

# Location
walk off the back

# Protection
no bolts or anchor
