# Description
Thin stemming quickly opens up to better jams.  The crux off the deck is tricky to protect, but there's enough gear that you won't drag your belayer off their stance.

The first ascensionists put the route up sans bolted anchor by continuing to the rim.  This was pre-guidebook and others put a two bolt anchor in at a logical stance below the rim, thinking that they had done the FA.

# Location
The line directly left of a large gray scar at the bottom of thin double cracks. (Steelhead)

# Protection
Doubles of Purple Metolius to BD 2.  A grey metolius might give you piece of mind off the deck.
