# Description
Long overlooked because it appeared welded with loose blocks, this crack finally was found to take gear and have solid rock. Expect techy stemming and palming, and finicky gear. A two bolt anchor was recently added.

# Location
Left of Lou Dog, in the center of the wall

# Protection
Pro to 4" (bigger gear for the bottom to surmount stubby column, with mainly finger pieces and nuts on the upper section)
