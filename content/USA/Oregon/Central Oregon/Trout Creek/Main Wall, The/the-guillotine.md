# Description
Long reaches between good jams lead to a gradually widening off-width finish. The angle eases slightly for the wide section, making it more forgiving than other off-widths on the Main Wall.

# Location
Two routes to the right of the hanging column on Geologic Time. It's the relatively small crack between Adipose and Gas Chamber with a recently exfoliated block at the start.

# Protection
Pro to 5". Anchors are set back from the top of the column. Careful not to get your rope stuck when you pull it.
