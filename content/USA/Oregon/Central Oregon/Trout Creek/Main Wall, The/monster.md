# Description
Monster starts as a tricky tips crack that gradually opens up to fingers and hands.

The technical crux comes fairly low, but after a couple of decent rests in the middle you'll still find yourself looking at a good deal of ever-widening hands before you reach the chains.

The opening sequences can be made significantly easier if you cheat a bit by laybacking and using the next crack over to the left, but if you're a purist try going straight in.

This is an incredibly fun route.

# Location
Just to the right of JR Token.  Start on the block and climb the chalked tip jams on your right.

# Protection
Small gear (tips) to large hands.
