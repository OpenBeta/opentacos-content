# Description
If you can reach the opening lock, the grade makes sense.  If not, it's really hard to get established on the route and it will be much more difficult.  Pull hard through the first couple moves and don't let your guard down higher up.

# Location
About 3/4 of the way towards the north end on the main wall.  Look for an obvious offset splitter with chains visible at the top under a plain ledge. The whole route can be seen from the Gold Rush base columns. (see photo)

# Protection
1-2 BD green C3s for the start and doubles of 0.3-1 with an extra 2 and 3.
