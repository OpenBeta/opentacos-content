# Description
Classic double cracks.

Some of the best backstepping, finger jamming, and stemming that you'll ever see on a 5.10.  The two finger cracks provide ample secure jams, and the gear goes in easily.

# Location
One route left of Mr. Squiggles.

# Protection
Fingers to hands.  You can probably sink a lot of medium nuts for the first half of the route.
