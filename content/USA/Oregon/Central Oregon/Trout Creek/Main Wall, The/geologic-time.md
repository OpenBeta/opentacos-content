# Description
This thing is a total must-do.  While it's not an enduro splitter, it's got varied and exciting pacing, enough gear for it to be a totally safe adventure, and super fun movement.  Start out on moderate thin hands that lead to a leftward roof-traverse.  Above the roof, lie-backs and fingerlocks quickly end as the crack pinches down and thin stemming moves on small gear get you to a classic thank-god hold and a rest. More insecure palming, smearing, and arete-pinching is interrupted by another jug where you set up for the final crux. Place your last pieces in the horizontal, and mentally prepare yourself for a wild and cruxy finishing sequence above the gear.

# Location
20' to the right of Gateway.  Look for the obvious roof feature.

# Protection
Doubles BD #1-0.3, Triples of blue Metolius, and doubles down to green C3.
