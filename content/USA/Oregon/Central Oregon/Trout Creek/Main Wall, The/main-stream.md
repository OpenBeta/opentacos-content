# Description
This is a new direct finish to the May Fly. The May Fly is one of the most classic hard lines at Trout and this variation is equally deserving of must-do status. You start Main Stream by climbing the sustained finger crack of the May Fly past the first mini crux, but instead of traversing left through the boulder problem, continue straight up the original crack as it seams out into almost nothing. Another ten feet of desperate face climbing takes you to the chains of Fissuremen. The run out up top is mitigated by placing a blue ball nut in the seam.

# Location
Start on May Fly

# Protection
Bring plenty orange and yellow metolius, two blue metolius, a purple metolius and a blue ball nut. A few BD equivalents are handy also.
