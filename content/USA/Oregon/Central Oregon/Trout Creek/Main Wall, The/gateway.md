# Description
Come expecting 40' of beautiful, BD 0.5 splitter to a funky crack switch to the left. (somewhat up to the climber's discretion, I found it easiest to switch when my feet were on the last large edge in the original crack, but others traverse left higher up)  Once established in the left crack, enjoy engaging finger locks and face moves to the chains.

# Location
This is the prominent rattly finger/ringlock splitter a couple lines right of Bushwhacker.

# Protection
Rumor has it that metolius cams don't fit as well as BD ones.  (oranges are tipped out and reds are over cammed)  I was stoked to have 4-5 0.5s, 2 0.75s and Doubles of BD 0 C3-0.3 C4 for the upper crack.
