# Description
This route is short. Aside from that, there's not much else to complain about. Sustained, technical cruxes, near-perfect rock, and beautiful positions highlight this classic line. The movement on this is completely atypical to your standard Trout Creek crack climb.

Begin with hyper-technical stemming and liebacking between a narrow off-set and a shallow dihedral. After pulling onto a decent stance at mid height, get back what you can before firing off a slightly harder mirror image of the Mayfly's crux lieback. From here it's only another 10' of .12- on sequential, flaring fingerlocks to the jug. Finish by mantling onto the jug and climbing up and left on positive holds to the chains. (the last sequence is a tad contrived due to the anchor location, but is a more aesthetic and classic finish that avoids moderate climbing on a big suspect block out right)

# Location
Left of Out Ridin' Fences.  Scramble up the chimney to the pillar ledge.  The line starts off the left side of the ledge.

# Protection
Purple-yellow TCUs.  Many blue TCUs/Red C3s, one #1 C4, stoppers useful.
