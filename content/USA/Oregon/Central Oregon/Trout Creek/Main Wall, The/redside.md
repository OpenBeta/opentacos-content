# Description
Dig deep as the difficult tips start to this climb is only the first crux. Difficult to place gear if laybacking this part.  Where your techniques transition will dictate the location of subsequent cruxes. Getting your first knee is a relief that doesn't seem to come soon enough. Transitioning from stacking to armbarring is tricky. This climb will work you through every size and manner of big jams.

# Location
This is the gradually widening tips to offwidth/squeeze crack to the right of Wondertwins

# Protection
A little bit of everything from micro cam to #9 Valley Giant. Can be done without the Valley Giant with big enough nuts. Exit right to a nice biner anchor.
