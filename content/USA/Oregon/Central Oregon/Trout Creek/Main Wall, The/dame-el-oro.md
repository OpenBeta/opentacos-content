# Description
Simply stunning.  Clip the Gold Rush chains, (or, if you're a purist, don't and place gear next to them) shake out, and commit to the gently overhanging, pocketed headwall above.  Big, technical moves on mostly big holds will see you to the chains above.

# Location
Directly above Gold Rush.

# Protection
Small stoppers and opt. small cams.
