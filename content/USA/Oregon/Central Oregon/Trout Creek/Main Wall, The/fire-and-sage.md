# Description
An excellent variation to Wengerbanger, this route traverses right at a horizontal break at two thirds height to access a rapidly widening fingers corner. The traverse is likely the crux and the climbing only eases the higher you go. Â If you hand traverse, it's probably mid 5.11 while foot traversing will knock the grade down a notch. (but is reachier) The climbing is excellent from bottom to top and should not be missed!

# Location
Starts up Wengerbanger. (right of U3)

# Protection
Gear to 2.5".
