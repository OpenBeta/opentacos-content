# Description
Straight in endurance hand jamming with cruxes at the start and finish.

# Location
The obvious hand-crack at the beginning of the Main Wall.

# Protection
BD 1-3 with a strong emphasis on the 2s.  If the overnight low is above ~40ºF, there's a decent 0.75 placement up high on the route.  Once the lows are consistently colder than that, the crack grows and it becomes tipped out.
