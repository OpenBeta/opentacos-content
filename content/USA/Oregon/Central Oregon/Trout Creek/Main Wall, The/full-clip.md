# Description
Another killer line. It's worth considering that this line and it's neighbor to the left were both put up on-sight, ground-up, on the same trip by one person.

Full Clip is basically the stemming version of Winter Sustenance. Climb through a seemingly endless 60' of yellow and blue metolius to a brief crux move followed by a tenuous no-hands stem. After this it's another 20' of sustained 5.10+ to the chains.

# Location
Full Clip is the endless fingers corner in darker rock immediately right of Winter Sustenance. (the elegant, super-chalked fingers splitter)

# Protection
The rack that worked great for me was:

4 blue metolius

8 yellow metolius

1 red metolius (opt.)

That being said, it'll eat pretty much anything in the blue-orange range (esp. yellow) and a red is nice to have for the top.
