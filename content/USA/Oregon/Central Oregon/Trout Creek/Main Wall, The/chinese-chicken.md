# Description
Twin Cracks with a seam on the left and an off-width on the right force creative movement to create another classic route. (if you're a chicken like me and avoid using OW technique whenever possible)  I suspect that this climb gets very little traffic because it has some wide bits, but don't let that deter you!  It's a great climb and the widest sections are easily lie-backed.

# Location
Chinese Chicken is the next set of cracks right of Fun Soup.

# Protection
I don't remember needing big gear for this.  I placed a lot of small stuff on the left and never felt sketchy, but you could definitely place wide gear on the right if you wanted to.
