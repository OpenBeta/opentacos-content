# Description
Straightforward jams up the left crack of a twin crack system lead to some sustained moves at mid height.  Gain a rest good enough to retie errant shoelaces from and charge higher to the crux.  Face moves on thin gear lead to another sporty Trout Creek finish.

# Location
The first deep stembox climber's right of Fingerlings.

# Protection
Doubles from BD 0.3-1 with an extra red C3, 1, and 2.
