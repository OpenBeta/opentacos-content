# Description
Another classic moderate.  Technical stemming w/fingerlocks at the start relent to classic Trout Creek twin-crack climbing.  Grab a shake at the top before bouldering up and right to the chains.

# Location
The double cracks 3-4 lines right of U4. A long, intimidating offwidth is to the right of Long March.

# Protection
Doubles of BD 0.3-3.  A #4 w/a long sling on it can be really nice to have to protect the finishing move.
