# Description
Straightforward climbing up a twin crack-stembox takes you to the flake.  The crux kicks in once you leave the flake.  Most agree that 5.10 is kind of a stiff grade for this route.  (it's been dubbed by some, 'the ruiner,' in reference to how their day went after 'warming up' on this route)

# Location
Climb the double crack-stembox 3 lines right of JR Token.  Has a distinctive loose-looking flake at 3/4 height that's actually quite solid.

# Protection
Doubles from BD .3-2 plus some thinner gear for the crux will be more than adequate.
