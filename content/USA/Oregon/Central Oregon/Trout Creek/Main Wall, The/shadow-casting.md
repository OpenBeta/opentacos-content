# Description
From theflyfishingforum.com: The shadow cast, no doubt, is a dramatic performance to witness. When done properly, it rivals the artistic beauty of the sweetest ballet. Unfortunately, it really has no real useful place in our casting arsenal. While being a sight to behold, it serves no other purpose other than to impress our friends and foe. Yet still, it remains a cast worthy of effort provided you have the time to learn it well.

This thing has some amazing movement guarded by some suboptimal protection.  Scamper up Lou Dog's opening chimney to a sit down rest before the business.  20' of physical moves on generally good holds lead to a final no-hands on a sloping shelf.  Above this is another 20' of brilliant, thin stemming and arete pinching with somewhat marginal pro.  From the finishing jug, I climbed right and scrambled up to the Lou Dog anchor to lower off.  Spanning over to Lou Dog would be hard if you're short.

# Location
In between Rocinante and Lou Dog.  Shares a start w/Lou Dog and is easily TR'd from the anchor with a yellow C3 as a directional.

# Protection
I pink pointed the whole thing because the gear is quite thin and not always exactly where you want it. (and I'm kind of a chicken) Bring lots of red/blue ballnuts, rps, a handful of purple and green c3s and a finger sized cam or two.  A hammer and funkness can be nice for testing and/or fixing small gear placements.
