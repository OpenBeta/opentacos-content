# Description
Maybe a little sandy for the grade, this route is a good step in the progression towards climbing splitter fingers.  Work through thin stemming off the deck and then climb the left crack on solid fingers for most of the rest of the route.

# Location
This is the route left of The Space Between easily identified by the overhanging, squiggly crack at the chains.

# Protection
Doubles of green BD C3s up to 0.75 with extra 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5
