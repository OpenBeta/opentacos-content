# Description
Awesome, varied climbing.  Sequency moves off the ground yield to a spectacular finger and hand crack that will take you to the ledge.  From here, work up a unique wide crack to an exciting move out a roof to the chains.  This would make for a great first Trout Creek 5.11-.

# Location
Two lines climber's left of Wondertwins is an enormous, very sketchy-looking block.  California Weakender climbs the crack to the stembox left of the block.

# Protection
Doubles of BD's O C3 to #2 C4 with an extra #3 C4.  Most people place in a smaller crack in the back of the wide crack to avoid hauling up big cams.  I was wishing I had slings to extend some of these placements.
