# Description
Original submission pared down to relevant info:

Place two pieces from the starting block and cast off.  Do three moves and place the red c3 no problem, ok, let's keep going!  Struggle with gear placement and endurance crux. Foot deadpoint, endurance crux, last boulder problem. There's a rest before the last boulder problem. The crux of this section is getting my left hand just right - it's a pinky down open hand flare lock.  And the ensuing right first finger mono lock. Flying high!

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Around 10 blue Metolius/red c3 size and 5 in the purple Metolius/green c3 size and maybe a offset blue yellow.

(RP'd with pre-placed gear)
