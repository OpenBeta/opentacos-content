# Description
Another moderate twin-crack system: one wide and one thin. The technical crux is probably the thin hands right at the start, but the wideness-intimidation-factor is likely why this line gets done so rarely. Wide climbing aside, this is probably the easiest line in the heart of the Main Wall and is totally worth your time. (no off-widthing necessary) At the top either step right to the Monster anchor or tunnel straight up the gut to daylight and build an anchor on top. The 'extension' is actually pretty cool, moderate, and protects surprisingly well.

# Location
In between JR and Monster.  Look for the massive wide crack with a few chockstones in it.

# Protection
I brought doubles to #3 C4 for going to the chains on Monster and was adequately protected.  The finishing chimney moves were airy, but you'd be hard pressed to change that.  A #4 wouldn't go unused elsewhere and it's worth noting that the second is exposed to a mild swing on the finish.
