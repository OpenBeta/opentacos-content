# Description
Splitter fingers forever.  Likely candidate for one of the best fingercracks anywhere.  A brief section of tips up high is probably the true crux, but not pumping off the sustained movement is the real battle.

# Location
Directly right of Space Between.  Just look for the jaw-dropping finger crack covered in chalk.

# Protection
As many blue and yellow metolius pieces as you need for 90' of fingers.  It's nice to have an orange or two for the top.  (you could probably place bigger, but you'll want to put your fingers there)
