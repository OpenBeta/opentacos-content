# Description
U4 is an intimidating route that requires wide stemming, laybacking and jamming to get to the top.  Placing gear can be difficult because your usually in a layback or wide stem when doing it and its hard to see the placements.  Don't let this discourage you though the climbing is never that difficult and the route is fantastic.  Shorter climbers may find the route more difficult, I'm 6' tall with a 0 ape index and felt 11- was about right.

# Location
This route is located approximately 100 to 150 feet to the left of JR Tolken.  Look for two cracks that are about 5 feet apart.  The right crack is in a large left facing corner and the left crack is in a very small (about half a foot) right facing corner.

# Protection
This route mostly takes .5 to 1 Camalot sizes with a few smaller cams and wires.  I think a gold Camalot fits somewhere but can't remember for sure.  There is a two bolt anchor with chains at the top.
