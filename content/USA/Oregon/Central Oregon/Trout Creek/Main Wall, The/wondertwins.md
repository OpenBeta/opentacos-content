# Description
Twin cracks about 3-4 inches apart make for interesting jamming for most of the route. An obvious undercling roof at the top provides the standard exciting Trout Creek finish.

As of 9/27/19, there's a new extension that climbs up and right from the chains.  Currently it doesn't have an anchor on top, but you can build one out of two (or three) #3s.  Bring a selection of tips gear and RPs (tricams could be useful) plus a #1 to protect enjoyable, bouldery movement on jugs and gas pockets up perfect rock to the rim.  The best finish ends on the arete.

# Location
Wondertwins is located two lines left of Fingerlings. Look for the tight twin cracks and the distinctive roof finish.  See Fun Soup's photo for more info. (WT is the twin cracks below the hexagonal roof on the left side of the picture)

# Protection
Doubles of BD 0.4 to 3 with an extra 3+ sized piece.
