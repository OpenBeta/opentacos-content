# Description
Longer than the average Trout Creek route.  Gritty thin hands and nice finger locks lead to a few hand sized openings up high.  After an easy to navigate wide section, pull a fun roof and climb easy moves on poorish quality rock to the anchor.  This thing gave me and my big mitts a pump.

# Location

# Protection
I brought many in the 0.5-2" range and used them all, a #3 and #4.
