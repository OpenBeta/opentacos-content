# Description
This route is super-neglected. The crux is mostly cranking hard on fingerlocks, so go get it! Climb splitter fingers and thin hands to a rest. From here figure out the funky sequence to gain a section of Wartley's Revenge-esque jugs. Finish by firing delicate and technical climbing up the crux finger and tips crack.

# Location
This is pretty much the furthest right route on the Main Wall.  There are others further, but they are of a very different character and not as classic.  Hike past Time Bomb and locate the splitter crack surrounded by tiny seams.  Scramble up and right to access the spacious belay ledge.

# Protection
A double rack from BD. 0.75 to green C3 plus a 1 and 2 should be more than adequate to stitch this thing up.
