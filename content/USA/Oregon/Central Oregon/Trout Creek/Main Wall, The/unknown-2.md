# Description
Another classic Trout twin-crack stembox.  Fire through the low, fingery crux to the better jams and enjoyable traverse up high.  Feels reminiscent of Space Mission, but a full number grade easier.

# Location
This is the third climb left of Suzuki.  It has an obvious leftward traverse that finishes at the chains of the neighboring route. (U3)

# Protection
Double rack from BD 0.3-2 with one #3 should suffice.  Slings might help managing the rope for the finishing traverse.
