# Description
Double Trouble climbs twin finger cracks that open up to off fingers/thin hands up high.  A combination of gastons, stemming, and jamming will get you to the Two Step anchors.  (10+) This is the easier version of Hip to Toe. You could also continue straight up through the slot (5.11) and top out. (gear anchor)

# Location
Scramble behind the satellite columns and climb the stembox immediately climber's right of Two Step Right.

# Protection
Red C3s protect the crux.  Finger sized and medium cams should protect the remainder.
