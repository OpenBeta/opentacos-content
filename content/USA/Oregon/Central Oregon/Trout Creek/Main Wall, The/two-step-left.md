# Description
Climb the wide-hand crack to the ledge, climb the crazy hand crack above that, and try to figure out the finish.

# Location
Scramble behind the satellite columns right of Gold Rush.  Two Step Left is wide hand crack on the left side of the pillar right as you get behind the columns. Look for the weird lightening-bolt crack up high.

# Protection
Triples of BD 2 and 3
