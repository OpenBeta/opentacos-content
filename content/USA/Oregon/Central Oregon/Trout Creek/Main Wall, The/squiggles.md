# Description
Probably the 3rd best hand crack at the main wall after Gold Rush and JR Token, although this one is going to feel quite a bit harder if you have large hands.

Place some good gear off the starting block and get ready for 10ft. of ringlocks before the hands start sinking in.  The zig-zaging nature of the crack makes for easier-than-average feet, but the climbing is somewhat relentless.

# Location
The obvious squiggly crack that lies 30-40ft. left of The Space Between.

# Protection
Lots of small-hands pieces, and up to a #3 Camalot for the top.
