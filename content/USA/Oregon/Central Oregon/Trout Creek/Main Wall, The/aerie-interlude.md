# Description
Climb the bouldery direct line between Steelhead and Gateway, via tiny face holds, flakes, painful tips locks, and some huge patina plates. Aerie Interlude is essentially a face climb and a series of 2 boulder problems with stances. The first is v4-v5, and the second is v6-v7. After the upper problem, you'll hit a hero jug rail on the left (similar to Mayfly) and finish up some stemming and finger cracks as per Gateway.Airy Interlude, in the Needles, is one of the country's most famous routes. This route was established on the last day of Trout's climbing season, before the eagle nest closure. Fans of crosswords will know the word Aerie, it must be Will Shortz's favorite way to crowd in the vowels.

# Location
Near the left end of the the wall, between a ringlocks splitter on the right and a grey-toned stem route on the left. This climb has very obvious patina flakes and jugs, and is easy to find. It has unique and athletic movement, huck a TR lap after doing Gateway or Steelhead!

# Protection
~ 2-3x from black alien to yellow, single #2 Camalot

From the ground I placed:

Black Alien

Blue Alien

# 2 Camalot

Black Alien

Silver C3

(Crux)

If you don't have a silver C3 (I don't think any other cam models are that small) I'm sure other gear is fine, maybe just a bit lower.
