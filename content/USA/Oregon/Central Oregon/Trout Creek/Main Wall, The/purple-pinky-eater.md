# Description
A double crack leads to a technical seam stem problem with various openings just big enough for finger tips.

# Location
Just to the right of squiggles.

# Protection
The double crack will take one and two inch pieces. When you reach the seam, purple and blue metolius tcu's or just run it out to the horizontal, which will take an orange metolius.
