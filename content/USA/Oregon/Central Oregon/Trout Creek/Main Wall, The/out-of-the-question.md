# Description
Start up the Question Air Box's heady first moves. From the top of the pillar, step left into an off-set fingercrack. Punch it through an awesome crux sequence and then savor the splitter waiting above.

The start is a definite detractor for some, but should be pretty casual for anyone who has any hope of sending the crux. That being said, this is likely one of the easier 12- routes to tick at the crag.

# Location
In between California Weakender and the Question Air Box.  Shares California Weakender's anchor.

# Protection
Gear to 1.5"  Many blue metolius. (plus a #4 C4 for the start)  Be mindful protecting the crux so that a fall doesn't land you on the top of the pillar.
