# Description
Classic! Easily the best pitch of 5.9 at the crag and likely Oregon's best moderate chimney trainer.  Scramble in from the left with the crux coming establishing yourself in the chimney.  Straightforward chimneying with gear in a gently widening thin crack.  Build an anchor on top and walk off to the right.  A good option for cold days.

# Location
On the far right side of the main wall, locate the obviously eerie chimney that lives up to its name.

# Protection
RPs up to a single rack to BD 2.
