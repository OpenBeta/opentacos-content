# Description
This is an excellent route with sustained stemming all the way to the top.  The route quality is right up there with El Matador but the stemming is not as far apart.  There are two cracks, one in each corner and they both take great gear.  Do this route and get ready for a good calve pump.

# Location
This route is located about 30 or 40 feet left of JR Tolken.  There is a short pillar directly in front of the route that you start off of.

# Protection
Medium wires and cams (mostly fingers) up to a red or gold Camalot will work.  There is a two bolt anchor with chains and biners at the top.
