# Description
This is the best line on The Prow. A thin crack at the bottom with some stemming. After about 25 feet the rock leans back for easier climbing. Once one gets above the columns (~50'), the route becomes a bit more jumbled but everything is solid. Avoid obvious loose chunks.

# Location
Middle of the prow. It's sort of an alcove 2-3 ft deep due to columns on either side.

# Protection
Gear to 2"
