# Description
Rodeo Crack launches into offwidth from the very start.  Begin with some heel-toe trickery and arm bars in a 5' section.  Progress through a long 4' section and another 5' section before the offwidth climbing is over.  The route turns into perfect hands and finishes in 5.8 territory. Shares anchors with Salad Daze and Bedside Manners

# Location
Nice flat spot left of Salad Daze. Look for the 5' section immediately off the ground.

# Protection
Two #5's, two #4's, three #3's. Doubles in .75-#2 Camalots.
