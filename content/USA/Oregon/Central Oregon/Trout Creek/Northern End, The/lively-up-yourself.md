# Description
The first 20' consist of a couple moves on good fingerlocks off the deck to a brief crux of rattly fingers to thin hands.  After the crack opens up to hands, the angle kicks back and you can enjoy a low-angle, upside-down version of Gold Rush to a sling anchor on the left.

# Location
Lively Up Yourself is located on the far left side of the Main Wall.  In Jeff's guidebook, he lists it as being on 'the northern end.'  Head to the that end of the Main Wall and locate a prominant double crack system made up of two 4-5 inch cracks.  The left crack should gradually taper down to hands higher up.  Lively Up Yourself is the line immediately right of those cracks.  If you're looking at the Main Wall from a distance, Lively Up Yourself is located where the last of the distinctive orange colored Rock that makes up the majority of the Main Wall fades to the grey of the North Side.

# Protection
BD 0.3-1 with doubles of 2s and 3s and one 3+ size.
