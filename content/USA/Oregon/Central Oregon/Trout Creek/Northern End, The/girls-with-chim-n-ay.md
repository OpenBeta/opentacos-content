# Description
Go in, yes in, the chimney. It's secure and interesting climbing with good gear in the inside cracks. But if you don't want to be in there forever, at some point you need to get out...

# Location
The deep, dark chimney between Sleepy Hallow and Diminishing Returns. If you don't see it you might be inside it.

# Protection
Gear to 5". The guidebook claims you can stop at the chains on the right. I ended up building my own anchor at the top of this route, belaying from the top, and "walking" (belayed) off left to the Sleepy Hallow anchor. Watch for loose rock at the top if you do this.
