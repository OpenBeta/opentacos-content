# Description
Twin cracks pinching off to a funky crux at the top.  The Wenger guide gives it 5.10+, so clearly, I disagree, but you should go see for yourself.

# Location
Around the corner to the north of Talkin' it Clean.  Look for a small block with twin cracks above and a horizontal break on the left at about 15-20 feet.

# Protection
Singles from BD 2 down to small (grey C3)
