# Description
From the guide: "A fun, Moderate crack suddenly turns into a thin little bastard. Expect problematic stemming above small gear placements. Despite the name, the route is reasonably clean and despite the grade, it shuts most people down."

You can place wires high for the crux, I felt like I was on a top rope through the business of it.
