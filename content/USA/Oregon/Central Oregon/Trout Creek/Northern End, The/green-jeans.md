# Description
Mr Green Jeans follows a slowly widening crack in a corner system formed by two adjacent pillars. Fairly decent jams and hidden away options make for a modest intro to wide climbing at Trout. A great precursor to its neighbor, Rodeo Crack. Shares anchors w/ Great Googlie Moogli.

# Location
Starts in the wide crack to the right of a column with a white-stained horizontal break.

# Protection
Mostly large gear, up to #5.
