# Description
Salad Daze starts just left of a 3 ft pillar. Start with hand crack to a horizontal split that joins a second wide hands crack to the climbers right.  Following these two twin cracks to the bulge, trend left and climb on horizontal jugs between two blocks.  The anchor is accessible once you stand on the block to the left.

# Location
First hand crack off the ground to the left of a chimney and a 3 ft pillar.

# Protection
.3 - #3 Camalots.  The twin cracks taper allowing from a variety of nut and smaller cam placements. Emphasis on 2's and 3's.
