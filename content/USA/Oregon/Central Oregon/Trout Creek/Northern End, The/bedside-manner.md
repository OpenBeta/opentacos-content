# Description
Start to the left of the Salad Daze hand crack on a thin finger crack.  This bouldery start requires a few physical moves before protection is available.  The climb works from hands to fists to a lie back edge in the offwidth pod back to fists. The crack tapers down to .5 C4's at the top. Climb between two blocks on jugs. Stand on the left block to clip the anchors.

Bedside Manner,Salad Daze and Rodeo Crack share anchors.

# Location
Just left of Salad Daze. Look for the finger start with an offwidth pod above.

# Protection
.4-#4 Camalots. Emphasis on 2'3 and 3's.
