Climb a sustained thin hand crack as it narrows to fingers. Enjoy a rest before fun finishing moves. The relatively clean rock, for the Northern End, make this a great route that's well worth it.

# Location
ItÂ’s the thin hand crack directly below the first set of anchors left of The Prow.

# Protection
Pro to 2". Bolted anchors equipped with chains and steel biners.
