# Description
Named after graffiti in the tunnel on the drive to Trout. A varied line that is heavy on fists and OW, with some reprieve from the stem box nature of the line. An anchor has been added, so climbers can now avoid the sketchy natural gear at the top and the heinous simul-rap off the column.
