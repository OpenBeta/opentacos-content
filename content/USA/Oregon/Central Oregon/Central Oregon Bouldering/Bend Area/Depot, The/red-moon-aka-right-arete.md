# Description
A great compression problem that starts immediately right of The Goblin.  Begin on a good flat edge and work up to a right crimpy sidepull.  Squeeze and slap your way up to good opposing sidepulls on the arete while standing on the start hold. More intense moves (crux for some) lead to the horizontal below the large block which is often dirty.  Traverse right and easily top out via the wide crack above.

# Location
Starts immediately right of the goblin, maybe 10-15' left of Blood Knuckle

# Protection
pads
