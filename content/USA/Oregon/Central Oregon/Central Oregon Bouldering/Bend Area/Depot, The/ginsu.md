# Description
Ginsu sit-starts the obvious gently overhung blade-like feature ~8ft left of The Big Easy. Some foot trickery and a well-placed heel hook bring you across the blade, first right, then left through a good side pull and into a finish jug. Tops out up high and right on easier terrain, although some stop at the jug.

# Location
~8 feet left (downstream) of The Big Easy

# Protection
one or two pads and a spotter is nice
