# Description
Starts on a large flake at head height and moves through a large horizontal crack up into a massive jagged pocket before the crux moves on narrow 3-finger pockets. A sit start from the low flake around the corner to the left is worth doing and bumps the grade up  notch or two.

# Location
Left most route on the cliff band as you enter the main area.

# Protection
One pad is good
