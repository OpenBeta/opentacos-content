# Description
Walk upstream from the Goblin about 100 yards and you'll find a small buttress near the rapids, the Outkast Buttress. Start on the ramp with big jug and climb up, then left to the flake/block feature that looks sus but is most likely solid. Probably has been done before so if there's an already-existing name, please suggest update.

# Location
100 yards upstream of the Goblin & Grantelope, small buttress right near where the rapids start.

# Protection
2 pads & spotter
