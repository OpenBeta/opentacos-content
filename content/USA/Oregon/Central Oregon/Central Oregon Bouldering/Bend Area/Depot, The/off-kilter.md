# Description
Start on some low holds to the left of the corner and move right for a few moves. Pull past some sidepulls up the vertical section. Maneuver past the hanging tree branches while topping out on the mossy slab.

The first section is fun but the topout is awful.

# Location
The obvious bulge in the rock that seperates the Filth Pig/Traverse Wall from the Ginsu section.

# Protection
A few pads
