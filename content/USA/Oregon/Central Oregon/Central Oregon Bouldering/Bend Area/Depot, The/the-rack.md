# Description
Starts matched on a chest height sloper, also the start hold for Big Easy, but goes left up a slanting seam cutting through a cool shield leading to a hard move to a blocky undercling/sidepull and even harder cross to a miserable rail. After a few more hard moves it rejoins the Big Easy at the obvious mail slot and shares the same top out

# Location
between Ginsu and The Big Easy, shares start hold and top out with Big Easy.

# Protection
couple pads are nice, the  last few moves before hitting the mail slot are up there a bit
