# Description
Start with hands matched at the bottom side pull thing just to the left of the crack and move to the really good jug just above the start hold and in the crack. Moving through the smooth and slopey crack is certainly the crux until you make it to the big jug that’s formed by the widening crack halfway up. Once you’ve made it there, the problem is about over and all that’s left to do is top the boulder. Feet at the end are very obvious and I just mantled up once my arms were above the edge. You have to be a little creative with the feet at the beginning but there are a few good smears and some good toe jams as well. Fun problem over all.

# Location
Just to the right of bloody knuckles. Obvious because of the precariously perched boulders above the problem.

# Protection
Very flat all I needed was one pad but two wouldn’t hurt.
