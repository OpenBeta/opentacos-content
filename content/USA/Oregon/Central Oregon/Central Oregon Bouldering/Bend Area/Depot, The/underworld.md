# Description
Start with your left hand on a pinch and your right hand low on the right side of the block. Make a few powerful moves before making your way up and over the lip. The climb ends at the obvious jug halfway up the wall. Walk off to the left or drop down if you have the appropriate pads and spotters.

Use only the loose block between the crack at the start for full V5 credit. Using the other footholds in reach makes this about a V3.

# Location
Located just left of the big crack to the left of Ginsu.
