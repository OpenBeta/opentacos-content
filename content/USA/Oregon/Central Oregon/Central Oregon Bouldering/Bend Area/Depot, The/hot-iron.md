# Description
Starts on an uncomfortably sharp RH crimp and a good vertical LH pinch in a crack at head/chest height. A few long moves on progressively better holds lead up and slightly right to a much easier, albeit tall, finish.

you are unlikely to hit the tree behind you if you fall, but a spotter there definitely helps with the pucker factor.

# Location
~20yds up river (climber's right) of The Wizard, on the right face of a right-facing corner.

# Protection
1 or two pads, spotter
