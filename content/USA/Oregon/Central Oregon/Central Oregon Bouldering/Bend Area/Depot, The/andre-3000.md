# Description
Walk upstream from the Goblin about 100 yards and you'll find a small buttress near the rapids, the Outkast Buttress. Start on the ramp with big jug and climb up, then right to the arete. Probably has been done before so if there's an already-existing name, please suggest update.

# Location
100 yards upstream of the Goblin & Grantelope, small buttress right near where the rapids start.

# Protection
2 pads & spotter
