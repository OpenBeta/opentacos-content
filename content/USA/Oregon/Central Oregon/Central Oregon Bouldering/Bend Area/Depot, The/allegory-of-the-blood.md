# Description
Links from Ginsu into the Rack via a pretty sharp traverse including a hard match, double gastons and a cool stab to catch the seam at the beginning of the Rack and joining that problem one move in. Makes the shouldery opening moves on the Rack feel a lot harder.

# Location
Climb Ginsu from the sit start then traverse right into the Rack

# Protection
couple pads, basically a sit start and a traverse into a bit of a highball
