# Description
Dr. Dog starts sitting on the left side of the cave to the left of tongue in Cheek. It moves through some sloping but good holds with a large ramp for the feet until the terrain gets much steeper. Using a cool undercling dish in the ceiling, bust some big moves out left to an ear-like flake. Moves up through jugs and tops out

There are some alternate and harder finishing variations by staying in the steepness and topping out more on the right of the mouth of the cave.

# Location
One of the first lines inside the cave on the left. Begins left of the tongue flake on “tongue in Cheek” start sitting on a good right hand undercling
