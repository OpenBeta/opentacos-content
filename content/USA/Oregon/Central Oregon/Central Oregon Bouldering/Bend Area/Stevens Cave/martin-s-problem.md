# Description
Make a couple big moves on good holds to the obvious large smooth jug. Trend up and left towards the mouth of the cave with plenty of options for heel hooks and other good feet. Reach the undercling dish shared with Dr. Dog, and continue to the end on underclings, pinches, and fun toe and heel hooks. The top out is the same as Dr. Dog, on the left side of the cave opening.

# Location
The starting flake is an obvious large chalked hold about 15 feet down from the entrence of the cave, on the left wall. It's the same starting hold as Tongue in Cheek.

# Protection
You're close to the ground the entire time, maybe 1 pad for the crux section if you're worried about landing on your back.
