# Description
Behemoth begins maybe 10-15ft right of Tongue in Cheek with a stand start on a nice two-handed undercling. It sets the tone with a big right hand move to a slotted hold then left hand into a semi-hidden undercling. From here take the path of least resistance while following the belly of the ceiling that sags lower than the rest of the surrounding rock. Heel hooks, toe hooks, all jugs and lots of hidden holds. It tops out through the biggest entrance on huge flat hero jugs.

Steep, physical, long, sharp, and pretty darn fun!

# Location
Left side of the cave. Follow the belly of the ceiling back and left about 30-40 feet to start holds. Alternatively it begins 10-15 ft right of the noticeable tongue sit start of “tongue in cheek”
