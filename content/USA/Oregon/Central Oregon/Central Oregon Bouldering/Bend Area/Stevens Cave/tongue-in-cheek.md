# Description
At least a grade easier than Behemoth, tongue in Cheek begins on the ground on the left side of the cave at a large 2ft tongue-like flake. Aim for the huge jug at chest/head height (likely the only non sharp jug in the cave). From here either a harder gaston beta behind you and to the right or a really big move to a jug up and left allow you to transition rightwards into the belly of the ceiling where the line links up with Behemoth around its midpoint.

It tops out the large mouth of the cave via the large flat jugs

# Location
Begin sitting at the large tongue flake feature. Move up and behind you trending right to link into behemoth and top out the cave
