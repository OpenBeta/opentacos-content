# Description
Starting Behemoth and linking into the only smooth jug of Tongue in Cheek. A link up that suffers from 2-3 moderately sharp holds, but still really fun. Felt much harder then Tongue though a notch easier then Behemoth.

Starting same as Behemoth with the big move to the mondo right hand and the hidden-ish left undercling. The fun is figuring how to get your left hand farther left into a sharp undercling/sidepull and your right into that hidden-ish undercling. From there big reach to a smooth jug and then some roof work links you to the smooth crescent jug of Tongue.

# Location
Same stand start as Behemoth on the double hand undercling blob
