# Description
Fun little route just north of the meadow camp parking lot not even five minutes away. Named for Austin's favorite south park episode he had watched the night before and the coincidental giant rooster lawn ornament across the river he deemed it "cock magic." This s**t is easy.

# Location
This route lies  about ten feet toward the water from the river trail. there is a slightly tracked path the heads toward it but don't rely on that as a landmark. The best landmark is honestly the giant (brass?) rooster lawn ornament that sits on the other side of the river which is directly across from the boulder problem. The problem itself is facing towards the river. To get down from the problem is an easy no-brainer; just push some sticks and bushes away.

# Protection
One crash pad will do the trick for this one, just be careful about the stabby plants around the area and on the backside descent and there may be a little litter around (i.e. glass bottles)
