# Description
Named after the classic Dolly Parton song "Jolene" stuck in Carson's head at the time, this problem features some fun little moves and crimps. Be sure to start your left hand on the good ledge directly up from the undercling and your right on the triangle to the right, ya cant miss it. The downside is this climb is kind of hard to find and is separate from the rest of the meadow camp problems.

# Location
this route is about thirty feet to the west of the river trail and stands alone with a big poderosa leaning up against it on the right.

# Protection
A boulder pad or two is ideal. A good brush will remove all that caked on dirt too.
