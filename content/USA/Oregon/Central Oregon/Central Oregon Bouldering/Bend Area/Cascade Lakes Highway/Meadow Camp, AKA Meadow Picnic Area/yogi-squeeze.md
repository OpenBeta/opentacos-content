Fun short suspended block. Start with chest high undercling and head up with cool movement. Ground slants downhill so a few pads or spot would be nice if you get too dynamic, but safe without

# Location
Right on the river trail heading from the parking. Careful not to block the trail with foam

# Protection
Pads
