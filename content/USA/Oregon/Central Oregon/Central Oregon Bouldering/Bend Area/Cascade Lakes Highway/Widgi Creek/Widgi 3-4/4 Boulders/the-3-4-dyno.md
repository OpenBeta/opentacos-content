# Description
Start with lefthand sidepull in the crack and a somewhat superfluous opposing right hand sidepull near. Move right and up to gain the jug on top.

# Location
Just to the right of an obvious crack, and with a distinct shelf-like block sitting a couple feet above the jug.

# Protection
Pads, spotters.
