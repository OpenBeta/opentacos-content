# Description
A fun little roof pull. Sit start under the roof that The Hole starts under, but pull out the right side. Left hand on the lowest hold under the roof with a left heel, right hand on a triangle crimp on the outside of the roof. Compress hard and bump your way out of the feature, trying to stay under the roof instead of just pulling out the right side early.

The guidebook calls this V3 and says "a lower start is possible", but it is quite contrived to think that there are two climbs here, so I'm just calling it one V5. Sit start as low as you can and just climb the roof.

# Location
Under the same roof that The Hole starts under, but pull out the right side.

# Protection
1-2 pads, lowball
