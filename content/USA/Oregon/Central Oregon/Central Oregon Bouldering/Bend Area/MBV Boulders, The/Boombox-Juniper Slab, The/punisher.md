# Description
A highly recommended highball. Stand start at the lightning bolt block, climb up through crimps and sidepulls. At the top set yourself up for a committing move to the lip high off the deck. Keep the tension. Top out onto the sloped shelf and walk off. Recommend scoping and cleaning this topout before giving it a send go, it can be dirty up on the shelf.

# Location
To the right of Juniper slab on the bluff behind the Hobo Boulders. If you're walking right of Boombox/Juniper, stay left on the trail instead of going down right to Hobo. Tall prow, hard to miss

# Protection
This climb kind of has a bad landing, a spotter and 3+ pads will make you feel better.
