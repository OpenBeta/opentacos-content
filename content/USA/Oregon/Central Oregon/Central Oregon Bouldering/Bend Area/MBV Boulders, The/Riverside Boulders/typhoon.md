# Description
Start on a left hand undercling crimp and a good incut with the right at head level. Use footwork and crimp strength to move left to the obvious jug and top-out straight up.

A potentially harder line could be done with a further left exit adding a few moves around the corner.

Would be surprised if this low hanging fruit hadn't been picked already. Feel free to update with FA info.

# Location
The obvious upside down pyramid on the river. Water starts to creep up during the warmer months.

# Protection
Few pads and a spot.
