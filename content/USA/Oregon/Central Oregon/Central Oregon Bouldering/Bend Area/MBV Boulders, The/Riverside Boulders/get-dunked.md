# Description
Start sitting with the sharp jug pocket. Make a big move left to the lip and mantle to topout.

It's useful to pile some of the old logs in the area in the water so that your pads don't get wet.

# Location
Around the corner to the left from The Pyramid Scheme on the same boulder.

# Protection
Pads
