# Description
On the right side of the boulder, around the corner from Wayside and Typhoon. Start on a good RH gaston at face height and lower LH side pull, move out left, then dyno to the semi-sloper rail (very similar to the Beastmaker 2000 slopers)! A true outdoor comp climb.

Just an FYI, the landing of this climb is usually under a few inches of water in the hotter months (occasionally gets lower in late spring, early fall). Prime time to hit this climb is the colder months (November through March)
