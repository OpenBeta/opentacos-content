# Description
Very fun problem featuring dynamic reaches between decent holds.

Stand start with two tiny side-by-side pockets, balance up to a sharp pocket on the right, stick the far-away left pocket, and then work over to the right arete. Work up the courage to commit to the arete, and follow this to the top. Awesome.

# Location
Middle/right side of the Wave boulder

# Protection
Pads/courage. Watch out for small rocks on both sides of the landing, especially if you end up barndooring off the right arete.
