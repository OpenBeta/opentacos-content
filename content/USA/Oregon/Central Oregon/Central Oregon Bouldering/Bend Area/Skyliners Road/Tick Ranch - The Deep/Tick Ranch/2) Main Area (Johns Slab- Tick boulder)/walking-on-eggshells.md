# Description
Start on obvious incuts on bottom right corner of boulder, work your way up and diagonally left using big reaches on good/decent holds (crux). Keep it together on one sloping hold near the top, reach right for a jug and top out.

# Location
Located on the large "Tick Boulder," this is the largest, most obvious boulder in this area typically with the most chalk.

If you're walking on the trail you can't miss it. It is just around the corner from John's Slab.

# Protection
2-3 pads
