# Description
Start on the obvious crimp rail on the mid/right side boulder, either finesse your way up the center, or launch up and far left for a great crimp. Work your feet up and find the finish jug.

For a longer problem, it is also possible to start awkwardly lower and to the left underclinging a questionable flake, then traverse up to the crimp rail at about the same difficulty.

# Location
Start just to the right of the tree, on obvious crimp rail

# Protection
Pads
