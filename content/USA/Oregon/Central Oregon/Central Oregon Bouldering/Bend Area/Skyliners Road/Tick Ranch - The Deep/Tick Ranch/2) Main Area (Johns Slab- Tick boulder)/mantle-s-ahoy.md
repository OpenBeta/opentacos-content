# Description
Start as for J.C.'s traverse, but after the first reach to the left launch up to the flat rail at the lip, get your other hand established over to the right on the rail and then commit to the mantle! Short but fun.

# Location
Shared start as for J.C.'s Traverse, but cut up instead of traversing.

# Protection
Pads
