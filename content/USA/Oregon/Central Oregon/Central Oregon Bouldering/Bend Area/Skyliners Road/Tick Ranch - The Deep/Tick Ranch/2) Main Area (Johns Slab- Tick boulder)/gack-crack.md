# Description
Some questionable rock on this one earns it an exclamation point in the book, so I listed it as PG-13.

Start by liebacking the obvious crack on the front right side of the Tick Boulder, work your way up this crack system finagling around some marginal blocks and carefully top out.

# Location
Obvious broken wide crack on front left side of the Tick Boulder.

# Protection
pads, luck
