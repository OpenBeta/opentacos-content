# Description
Awesome overhanging finger crack. Big pulls between good locks. Seems like most people reach the jugs on the right and drop off (that's what I did). You could continue up the crack or face, but it looks like it would be about a 5.10- free solo on choss.

Start low with good finger locks, pull up, then pull up some more, then fire for the jugs up on the right and drop. If it was in Yosemite it would probably be a (sandbagged) V4, but whatever it's a great climb regardless.

# Location
Overhanging finger crack cut into a section of the main cliffband just East of the trail junction

# Protection
Pads, a rope if you wanted to go to the top.
