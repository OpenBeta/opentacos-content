# Description
This is actually a pretty fun problem if you take the time to clean the upper holds off first.

Easiest line on the Razor Wall, roughly a direct line up the center. Work up from the start to a two handed jug-pocket. From this, work your way up to a delicate finish (which may be impossible if you don't clean the pine needles off first).

# Location
Climbs roughly the center of the wall. Stand start with a sidepull/pinch for your right, and a lower pocket for your left.

# Protection
Brushes/pads
