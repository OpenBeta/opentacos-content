# Description
Start with crimp sidepulls (there are a few to choose from around the same height). Work up to the obvious rail. Hike your feet up and huck for the top. Very fun.

# Location
Climbs the center of the inside face of a boulder standing adjacent to the cliffband, and facing the Bastard Crack.

There is a tree just behind you on this one.

# Protection
Pads, spotter to keep you away from the tree/boulders at the base.
