# Description
This short overhanging blob with a couple fun good moves is not a classic. It starts in the corner and moves left thru overhanging jugs. Do a large move out left  to a perfect whole pad crimp, set up your feet and throw for the top. It’s great movement. Direct start option hasn’t been done yet.

# Location
Park at first campsite and walk 100 ‘ up hill. Its on left side of trail.

# Protection
one pad
