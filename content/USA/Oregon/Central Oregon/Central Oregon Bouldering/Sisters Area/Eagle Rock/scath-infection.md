# Description
Big flat looking face on north east side of saddle trail. This was done long ago but never put in. It was the first line on this boulder. I want to roll with the scath theme Eli had going. Great holds on vert face down low lead to slab top out. Maybe a little hi-ball.

# Location
Itâ€™s just off the main trail going thru the saddle on north east side. Walk thru manzanita from main trail on slight trail to base.
