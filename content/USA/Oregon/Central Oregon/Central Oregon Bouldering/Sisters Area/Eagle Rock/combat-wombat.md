# Description
This boulder is located right between grim reaper and shark fin. This traverse is maybe a bit contrived, but powerful and overhung in places. Sit start on the NW corner of the boulder, see photos for start. Traverse right around the boulder staying as low as possible. Avoid the small block wedged in by your feet or it cuts the grade to V0-V1. Continue right around the boulder as far as possible before top out.

# Location
Between Grim Reaper and Shark Fin. On the SW side of the area overall.

# Protection
It's a boulder traverse. Use some pads if you want em.
