# Description
Great Great Boulder. Ive had entire sessions on just this one boulder. Best warm up starts with the jug line in the crack down and left and traversing up and right to top out center . Don't be turned off by the v0 warm up rating. This is a great work out boulder. There are countless cutters and edges suggesting hard variations to the top. Sit down starts are necessary lots of classic v4  moves on overhung rock; All connecting to top out.

# Location
NE side; If you walk up from north end of parking lot it is the first   boulder.
