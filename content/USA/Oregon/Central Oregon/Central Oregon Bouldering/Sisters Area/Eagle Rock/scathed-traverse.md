# Description
Traverse, start same as Scathed Beauty.

Traverse right to left and continue to topout on face high block. There is a large cheatstone that drops the grade if you use it.

# Location
This boulder in on the East side of the main rock formation, when taking the main trail from the parking area to the saddle/ridge/summit you will exit the trail to the right just before the top, you'll see rocks about 100 ft from the trail. You'll know you're in the right spot when you see a scratched up wall with really low quality graffiti and names.
