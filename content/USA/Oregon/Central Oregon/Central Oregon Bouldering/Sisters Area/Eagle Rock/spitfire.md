# Description
Overhanging rounded buttress which climbs thru a series of left hand slopers to better holds at the lip. Catch a rest before pulling the slab moves for the top out. Very exciting indeed. I had 3 pads and a spot.

# Location
East side of the north peak. Pull into first parking at Eagle then go straight up hill 150 feet. Catches sun mid morning and bakes till about 3 in the summer. Early or late in the day is best.

# Protection
lots of pads
