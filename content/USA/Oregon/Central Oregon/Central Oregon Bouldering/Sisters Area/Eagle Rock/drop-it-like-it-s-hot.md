# Description
Start 5ft left of teardrop. Jam yourself as deep it the left crack as you can, start matched hands on a face high ledge. Traverse right, once you move around the bulge there is a slight downclimb, crux imo, continue moving right around the block, gets pumpy, finish is the same as lemon drop (mantel the small black once your back is to the tree). This is a fun and pumpy route! Hop on it and give me your opinions on the grade.

# Location
On teardrop block. See map.
