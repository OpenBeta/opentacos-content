# Description
Nice hand-to-fist crack. Crux is where it widens up at the top. Likely harder for smaller hands.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Use bolt anchor for "Pre-school" crack to the right. A #4 cam is highly recommended at the top as a directional due to swing potential.
