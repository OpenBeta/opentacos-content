# Description
The golden face between "Tight Squeeze" and "Hercules". Â Almost dead center of the face, start on two head high pockets and make moves up to the flat ledges above. Move into the left facing rail then out right to a gaston crimp. From here move through the pockets of varying sizes straight up the slightly overhanging face. Technical and committing to the last move. TR anchors up top, but makes for an amazing boulder problem.
