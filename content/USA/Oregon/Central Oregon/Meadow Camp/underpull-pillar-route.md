# Description
If this had a better landing (or lower crux) it would be a classic highball boulder problem. TheÂ movement is excellent, and comes to a puzzling crux moving onto the slab (where it looks like it would be easy from the ground).

Start from a thin low left hand pocket and right hand around the corner on a good opposing pocket. Squeeze your feet on and balance your way up the pillar to aforementioned onsight crux pulling onto the slab. Finish up the same 4 feet of easy crack as the adjacent routes.

# Location
Obvious pillar that creates two much easier cracks on either side.

# Protection
Toprope from bolts
