# Description
Climb up either side of the apron-like pillar to a ledge, then up the short corner to the top. On the right side you can climb up either some easy (5.7) face, or up the hand crack and traverse--although it is more natural to just continue up this crack to the top.

# Location
Approximately halfway down the cliffband.

# Protection
TR, or lead with fingers/thin-hand size gear.
