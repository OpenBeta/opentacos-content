# Description
Follow obvious chalked holds just left of a boulder (much more difficult if one uses only the chalked holds, and contrives to avoid the chockstones/boulder), diagonally up and right to an obvious deep pocket, then straight up to anchors. Would not recommend as an onsight solo/boulder due to somewhat deceptive upper holds.

# Location
Just around the corner from an obvious splitter finger crack, this is on the left face of the corner where the three big wide cracks are.

# Protection
TR from eye bolt directly above, backed up by anchor for the splitter around the corner.
