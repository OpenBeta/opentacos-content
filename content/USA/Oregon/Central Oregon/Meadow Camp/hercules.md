# Description
This is the obvious and imposing 5 to 7 inch overhanging offwidth crack, the rightmost of the three prominent wide cracks on the same wall.

It's like a really, really miniature version of "Big Guy" at the Creek, same sizes and everything.

Name and grade come from the Falcon guide, take with a grain of salt.

# Location
Rightmost wide crack on the wall of three wide cracks. Big wide crack, you can't miss it.

# Protection
Pants, long sleeves. a 4, 2 x 5s, 1 x 6 BD if you want to lead it. Wouldn't recommend pushing cams for too long because you are very close to the ground.
