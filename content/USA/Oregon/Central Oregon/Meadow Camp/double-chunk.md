# Description
Essentially the same crack size as "Straight Split," but with more features for feet and additional hands. Be careful as the flakey edges are quite friable.

# Location
Hand crack in the corner just to the right of "Straight Split." More towards the beginning of the cliff.

# Protection
TR from anchors directly above, or lead with thin hand size pieces.
