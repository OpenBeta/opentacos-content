# Description
climb the prominent arete between pre-school and happy man. This arete features two mantle moves that are separated by thin face climbing. the first mantle is by far the easier of the two but both take some balance and trickery to get through. the climb then finishes on the final 5 feet of the left variation of Pre-school.

# Location
directly to the right of happy man on the arete that separates Pre-school.

# Protection
n/a TR from bolts for pre-school
