# Description
Perfect hand jams up a steep crack just left of "Crescent Crack." Much less traveled, but very enjoyable in my opinion. If only it went on forever..

# Location
Just left of "Crescent Crack," start up on the boulder.

# Protection
TR from "Crescent Crack" bolts, watch out for the swing or don't fall. Directional highly recommended.
