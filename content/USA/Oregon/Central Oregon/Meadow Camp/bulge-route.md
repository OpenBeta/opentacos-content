# Description
Difficult and sustained. Climb up faintly chalked holds and hard to see feet.

A couple ways to start, the most natural seems to be going from the chalked sloper up to a left hand side pull pinch, and then working up the shallow dihedral feature on the right.

The first two thirds of the route is beautiful and delicate balance climbing on very thin pockets and edges.

Reach a rest below the big overhanging bulge and power over it to the top.

If this line was bolted, or had more convenient top rope bolts it would get climbed all the time.

# Location
5 feet left of "fingers through bulges." Start one of several ways. I started with my left hand on the obvious left facing shallow corner, and right hand in a small pocket. You could also start left of this on some chalked holds and go from there.

# Protection
Single eye bolt above the route, backed up by the new 2 bolt anchor for "fingers through bulges" two feet to the left (climbers right). Watch out for the pine tree branches at the top.
