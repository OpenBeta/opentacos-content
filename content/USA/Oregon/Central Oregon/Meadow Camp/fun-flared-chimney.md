# Description
A very enjoyable chimney to climb, with a nice variety of face holds to work with. Probably a good first chimney. Vastly easier or harder depending on which side of your body you put in. Have fun.

# Location
As you reach the beginning of the cliff coming up the first well-defined trail to it, this will be the obvious chimney to the left of two hand-ish size cracks.

# Protection
TR from tree, be careful of loose rock
