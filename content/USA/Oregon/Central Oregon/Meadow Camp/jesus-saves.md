# Description
"This is a difficult but awesome right-facing arete." Â There are two bolts for a TR over the right face. Crux comes after the halfway-ledge, where the solid arete hands contrast with thin feet. Easy top out and great route overall! (Route info from Rock Climbing Oregon Falcon Guide + my experience)

# Location
The obvious arete across from Crescent Crack.

# Protection
Two bolts with hangars.
