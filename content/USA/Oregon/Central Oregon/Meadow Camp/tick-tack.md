# Description
Climb the left side of the flake using liebacks and fingerlocks. A little more strenuous than it looks from the ground, but not deserving of the 10b rating it gets in the Falcon guide.

# Location
The left side of the little alcove "The Psycho" is in.

# Protection
Really long slings from a tree, easiest if you're TR soloing.
