# Description
This is really an excellent line, continuous and sustained with one good rest in the middle.

Start on thin holds and move up in a straight line (harder),

or start slightly left (uphill) and use big sidepull pockets to join the direct start (easier).

Make a few dynamic moves to reach a big jug/ledge and mantle up. Move out right into more difficult and continuous terrain. Stellar.

# Location
Ascend the obvious chalked pockets immediately to the right of "Stars next door"

# Protection
TR from bolts.
