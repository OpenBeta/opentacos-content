# Description
Climb the obvious crack, using some jams and a lot of face holds.

# Location
This route is on a separate block from the main wall, about 30 feet back towards the parking lot if you're walking from the first routes at the main wall. If walking from the parking lot, the first fainter trail up to the rocks takes you here. On the backside is a nice V0 crack with crux at the top.

# Protection
A couple hand size pieces to lead, and a couple more for an anchor. Scramble off to the right. (Or walk around to setup a TR, trad gear required)
