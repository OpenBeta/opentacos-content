# Description
High quality grunting in an awkward flare, face holds ease the difficulty some especially near the top.

While it is a well known fact that all chimneys are 5.8, I listed this one a little higher to help with self esteem issues in a sport climber town.

If this was three times as tall it would be a classic. Still good fun, and a good place to hone awkward flared chimney skills.

# Location
Obvious flared chimney that is about 7-10 inches deep in the back. In line with the corner of a detached boulder that forms a 4th class chimney further back, and provides easy access to the top of the cliff.

# Protection
Shiny anchor bolts at the top. 2 BD 5s and a 6 to lead. Pants, sleeves.
