# Description
Fun continuous movement right off the ground, working through unusually large features for meadowcamp. Good footwork is rewarded, gain a ledge and balance your way into position of the second (but much easier) crux-reaching the topout.  Could be a highball boulder problem if it was just the lower crux and a better landing.

# Location
Walk around to the right from the first set of cracks you come to, this is the line in the middle of the first clean face you come to (maybe 50' around the corner). Identify based on the enticing 1' sloping ledge features (see photo).

# Protection
TR from eyebolts. If you're at the top of the cliff, these are the very next set of bolts after the bolts for those first couple cracks.
