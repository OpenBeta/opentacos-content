# Description
Start out with some face climbing and work into a fingers/layback crack higher. Requires surprisingly little crack technique.

# Location
Near the far end of the cliff band. The rightmost of 3 finger-sized cracks, and just left of the obvious chalked-up arete climb.

# Protection
Finger sized gear + nuts, might be a little bit of a dangerous lead down low. Or setup a TR off the nice bolts at the top.
