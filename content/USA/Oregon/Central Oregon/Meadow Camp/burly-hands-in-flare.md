# Description
Great hand jams in a crisp gritty crack, they're just a little hard to reach. Really a pretty neat climb.

# Location
The leftmost and shortest of three wide climbs, this one seems much more seldom done.

# Protection
Hand sized cams.. or use the bolt anchors from the wide crack/chimney a few feet to the right and don't fall, it'd be a bit of a swing (directional recommended).
