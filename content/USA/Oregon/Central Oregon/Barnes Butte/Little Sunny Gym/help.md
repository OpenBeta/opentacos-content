# Description
This is shorter with a few hard moves, finding a hold on the arete is probably the crux. If this was longer of a problem it would be much higher rated. Worth wile if your in the general area but not worth the drive from Bend.

# Location
Big rock on the right, with a V00 down climb to the left. If you follow the face from the bike trail this is one of the last solid rock faces.

# Protection
Pads, or friends, or both?
