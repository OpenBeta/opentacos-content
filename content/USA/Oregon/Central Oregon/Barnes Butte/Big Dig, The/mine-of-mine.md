# Description
This boulder is a decent warm up for a project close by, it has a slew of different holds/styles. Crux is a fun big move getting from the left to the right side.

# Location
This problem is on the north west side of The Big Dig, and starts on the crimps.

# Protection
Pads, pretty good area for landing.
