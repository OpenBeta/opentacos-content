# Description
This is a sit/squat start and moves to a crimp followed by a sloping crimp (hard to find), then streight up to a jug. The route is a tricky one to figure out! Definitely worth checking out!

# Location
Low start, same as mine of mine. Top out is also the same. Just stay on the face and its all fair game. Downclimb is to the left same as everything on The Big Dig.
