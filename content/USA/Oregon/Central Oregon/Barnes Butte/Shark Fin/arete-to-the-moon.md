# Description
Fun way to top out on the face, the arete is pretty straight forward and the top out is easy.

Bring multiple pads to protect the boulders, mainly left of the start.

# Location
East face, start is low and uses a small shelf and pocket.

# Protection
Crash pad, falling from the top on only one crash pad would hurt because of two boulders right and left of the start. If you can bring a friend or a couple pads.
