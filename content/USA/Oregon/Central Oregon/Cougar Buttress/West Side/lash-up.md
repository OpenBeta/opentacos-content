# Description
Clip first bolt from the ground, negotiate some difficult balance moves off sharp crimps to clip the second bolt from a good hold (possible ground fall if you blow the clip). Climb up to an off-line bolt, clip it and work right up the sweet jug arete (very cool feature). Clip another bolt and back onto the main face and up to the anchor.

Short, but fun. Definitely worth doing.

# Location
This route is on a separate little dagger of rock leaning in front of the wall. Visible on the left from the descent gully (on the right if you are actually descending from a higher route), comes into view just as you hike past the Ponderosa Pines up towards Sharpen Your Teeth.

# Protection
Approx 4 bolts, 2 bolt anchor currently with carabiners on them for lowering/rapping
