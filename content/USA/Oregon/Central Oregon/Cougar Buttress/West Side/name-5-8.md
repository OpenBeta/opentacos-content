# Description
Wide crack with hand jams but also face holds. The crux is getting off the ground through a bulge with steep hand jams. Above, expect well protected crack climbing with plenty of stable face holds on each side for variety. Mantle onto the huge ledge 50 feet up, then traverse right and then up easy and fun terrain with ample gear (.5 to 2 inch up there) to a shiny anchor that is visible if you stand back far enough from the base.

# Location
Walk a tiny bit further west and uphill from the route "Windy Corner" ( which is on the arete at the base of two tree gully) and this is the obvious wide crack right next to the giant ponderosa pine at that arete. Basically just west of Windy Corner.

# Protection
Gear to 3 inches, doubles from .5 to 3. A 4 or 5 inch could be used, but it's not needed if you leapfrog or bump gear.
