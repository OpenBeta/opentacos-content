# Description
Excellent route up steep crimps and jugs along an exposed arete. Clip two bolts up the overhanging start to an easy run to the next bolt up on the face (optional gear placements). Continue clipping tightly spaced bolts and pulling on great holds to 2 bolt rap anchor.

# Location
Obvious bolted arete just to the right of the giant ponderosa at the base of the descent gully.

# Protection
Bolts, optional gear placements in horizontals between 2nd and 3rd bolts.
