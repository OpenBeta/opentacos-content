# Description
P1 5.10a, 30m/100ft

- Crimpy face climbing leads past three bolts and into an easier but vegetated corner. From a good stance continue up staying on the face of the buttress as it steepens and passes one more bolt before it exits to a 2 bolt anchor.

P2 5.10a, 30m/100ft

- Climb an easy slab past a bolt and then move right on to a vertical face. Climb up and move right past a roof bulge, passing a bolt on your way towards a shallow roof split by a crack. Ascend the crack thru the roof and follow the face above enjoying the spectacular position and exposure. A final bolt protects the move to the anchors.

# Location
