# Description
Climb the chimney splitting the wall in between Something Man and Nothing Man.

Would be possible to climb it many different ways, but the easiest seems to be to follow the finger crack running along the right wall (which is used as a lieback on Nothing Man) up and then finish up to either anchor after the chimney narrows to an offwidth near the top. Getting out of chimney mode, pulling a few offwidth moves (semi-optional) and joining a sport route on either side is the crux.

Finger crack and upper chimney could use some cleaning to make this an enjoyable lead, for now it's possible to toprope off the anchor for Nothing Man to the right.

# Location
Chimney splitting main slab which narrows to offwidth size at the top, between two sport routes.

# Protection
TR from Nothing man, or lead with finger to hand sized gear (possible to reach out and clip bolts on either side at times also)
