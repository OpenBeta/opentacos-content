# Description
Mostly just face climbing around the wide crack for protection. Start on the obvious wide crack and lieback up around the bulge (crux). Then follow the crack systems trending up and left following easy edges to the anchor.

Would be a better route if it was climbed more, still a friable top layer of rock that needs to come off.

Apparently this route was retrobolted at some point and then the bolts were later removed.

# Location
Obvious wide crack to the right of the giant ponderosa at the base of the descent gully. Shares an anchor with The Windy Corner sport route to the left of it.

# Protection
Gear to 4" 2 bolt rap anchor
