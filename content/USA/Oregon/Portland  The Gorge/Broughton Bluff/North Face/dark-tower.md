# Description
Climb frodo's journey on the left side of the north wall, skip the anchors and head up a devious dihedral.  Once you're into the roof, attack the first crux to a lip jug.  Some 5.12 face moves just before the headwall requiring sidepulls and heel hooks.  Entering the final headwall, small crimping sidepulls and weird feet protect the chains with the final "crux".  It is a very large chance that you will fall on the last move at least once.  Grade not confirmed.

# Location
Left side of the north wall, start up frodo's journey till the ledge, then go straight up into the dihedral, this is where dark tower starts.

# Protection
Bolts
