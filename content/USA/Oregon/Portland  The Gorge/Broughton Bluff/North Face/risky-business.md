# Description
Risky Business starts at a nice belay ledge which is most easily accessed via

Gandalf's Peach

.  Climb out left from the belay on a series of large, sloping edges.  Round the corner and disappear from view of your belayer.  Move up past a fixed pin and make some long reaches to jugs.  After the piton the climb gets steeper though large jugs continue to appear at opportune times.  Pull up to the p2 anchor for Gandalf's Grip.  The second pitch of Risky Business starts by traversing right past the p3 dihedral of GG.  Get into the next dihedral over and head to the top.  From what I gather, p2 of RB is rarely done.  Keep an eye out for Poison Oak near the top.

# Protection
Gear to 2" for Gandalf's Peach.  Consider using runners on most of the bolts on p1 of Risky Business.  Gear to 1" for the second pitch.
