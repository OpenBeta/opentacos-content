# Description
Located in the middle of Bridge Cliff is a clean crack topped by a roof with a bolt on it.

Pitch one: Do some easy climbing on gear to get to a crux bolt, make the crux move right around the corner. Place some more optional pro and make your way to anchors.  There are three anchors on the ledge. I went to the middle one to set up for the second pitch. Tim Olson calls this pitch 5.11 but I'm unsure if it clocks in this high. Let me know what you think the grade should be!

Pitch two: kicks up with some intensity. Follow the bolt line immediately above you.  I found moving off the first bolt to be the first crux. Tim calls this 11+ and that feels somewhat accurate to me. I am interested to see what people think is a solid grade for both pitches.

There is a third pitch but I have not been on it yet.

Note: the first pitch historically did not have a bolt on it.  Someone added it recently. It is my understanding that there is consternation among some folks about it.

# Location
In the middle of Bridge Cliff. Climb up to roof and move right around. Continue directly up for second pitch

# Protection
Gear to crux bolt. Bolts from there to the top with an optional #1 BD after crux. Bolts from there up.
