# Description
There is an obvious bolted face/crack climb about 7ft to the right of Eagles Wing. Starts on face holds traversing right into an awkward crack followed by a tame topout onto the ledge with two sets of anchors. Both are in good condition as of Jan 25, 2021.

There is a second and potentially third pitch for this climb.

# Location
Rightmost route on the small bluff 1 minute past the main Red Wall area, but before Spring Rock and the Batwall.

# Protection
Bolts... not very many, its short. Optional pro in the crack, and the whole route could probably be lead on Trad, I don't know, I'm not a trad climber.
