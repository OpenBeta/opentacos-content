# Description
Start up some moderate slab-esque climbing. Then at the third bolt the first real move comes, make a hard strenuous move to a decent crimp. Collect yourself and get ready for the crux. This section is extremely cryptic and appears blank at first. Once the crux is negotiated continue up over the top of the pillar and clip two FAT mussy hooks.

# Location
Right up the middle of the start of Bridge Cliff

# Protection
Bolts with Mussy Hooks up top.
