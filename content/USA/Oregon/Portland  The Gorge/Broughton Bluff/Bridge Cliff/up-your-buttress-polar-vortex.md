# Description
Up your Buttress (known as Polar Vortex in the Tim Olson book) is a somewhat interesting climb on the left hand side of Bridge Cliff. You can either climb it as a 70M rope stretcher or break it into two pitches at the low anchor. Climbing from the bottom of the cliff to the very top makes for an epic long climb. If 5.9/ 5.10- is near your limit, it is advisable to break it into multiple pitches due to the dangers of decking on the many ledges on this climb.

If climbing with a 60m rope, lower (or rappel) to the first set of anchors, pull the rope, and lower (or rappel) again.

# Location
The first bolted line on the left hand side of the main face.
