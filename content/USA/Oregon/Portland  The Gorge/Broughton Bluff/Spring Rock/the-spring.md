# Description
The Spring is a short crack climb near the center of the Spring Rock formation. Keep your head on straight for the starting moves as you won’t have protection and the climbing is not trivial. The crack starts roughly fifteen feet off the ground and with it your first chance to place gear. Through the middle of the climb the jams are often flared and somewhat insecure feeling. Despite this, the protection is reliable and plentiful. At two-thirds height, a bulge needs to be negotiated (crux). After the bulge a combination of the narrowing crack and some face holds will get you to the anchor.
