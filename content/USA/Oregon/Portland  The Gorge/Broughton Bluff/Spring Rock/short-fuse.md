# Description
A short but fun moderate route.  Start on a vertical wall with good holds off the ground.  Fun moves take you through two bolts and the crux.  After the second clip go up and right onto a ledge.  Bring some nuts or a small cam to protect the final mantle to the anchor.

# Location
It is the obvious bolted line on climbers right of Spring Rock.

# Protection
Two draws and some small pro.  The anchor is two large rap rings.
