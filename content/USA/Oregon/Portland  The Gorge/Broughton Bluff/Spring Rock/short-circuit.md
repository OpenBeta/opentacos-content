# Description
Relatively easy climbing leads to the first bolt and a decent stance to contemplate the hardest move on the climb. There are a few ways to surmount the first bolt crux. Short climbers have to work a little harder here, though I'd say the movement is less height dependent than that of Thai Stick. Clip the second bolt and step left for a good shake. Another reachy crux must be negotiated before pulling on to the ramp. Once in the small dihedral, it's an easy romp to the anchor.

Short Circuit is short! I think, because of its brevity it is given a relatively modest grade, though the moves on it are surprisingly strenuous.

# Location
Short Circuit is the furthest right bolted route on Spring Rock.

# Protection
2 bolts + fixed anchor (shared with

Short Fuse

)
