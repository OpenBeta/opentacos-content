# Description
Ground Effects best moves are at the beginning and unfortunately the top of the route is quite dirty and mossy.  If someone took the time to clean it, the route could be better.

A very interesting knee-bar move at the start sets up a long reach and takes you through the crux, but pulling the second roof is a little tricky too (mainly because of the dirt and moss).

# Location
This route is located on the Spring Rock formation, which is just before the Bat Wall.

# Protection
Bolts. Sport clip anchors on the shared anchor.
