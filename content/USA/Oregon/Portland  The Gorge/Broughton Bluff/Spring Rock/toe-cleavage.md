# Description
Start up mossy, dirty rock to a stance. Use face holds and the crack to pull yourself up and find small, slick feet. Continue up, using face holds to your left, while jamming your toes in little pockets. The crux comes between the 2nd & 3rd bolt, with a smallish right hand crimp. Scramble up to just below the ledge, place a stopper and/or cam in the short crack at your right hand, then pull over the ledge to the anchor.

From here you can top-rope Free Bird and Ground Effects. This is probably the only reason you would want to do this route.

# Location
Far left side of the Spring Rock.

# Protection
2 SS bolts, a #8 BD nut and/or 0 Metolius cam
