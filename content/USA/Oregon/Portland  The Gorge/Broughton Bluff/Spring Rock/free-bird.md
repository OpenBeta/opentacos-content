# Description
Near the center of Spring Rock is a strenuous double tiered roof climb.

Free Bird

takes on both roofs although the crux is moving between the two.  The easier top section is mossy and tends to hold moisture long after most routes have dried.

# Location
Near the center of Spring Rock.

Free Bird

can easily be top-roped by running up

Toe Cleavage

, which shares the anchor.

# Protection
Four bolts plus a fixed anchor.  There's a vertical slot in between the first and second bolts (not visible in picture) that will take a #.75 C4.
