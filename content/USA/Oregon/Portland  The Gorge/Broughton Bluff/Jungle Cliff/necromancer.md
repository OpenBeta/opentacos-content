# Description
Originally an old aid line (Killer Pygmy), this now offers excellent free climbing on unique features.

Start at the broken column and work your way to the ledge. Take the rightmost bolt line that leads you to a ramp that angles up and to the left. From here, stay on the bolt line that keeps you in the corner heading straight up. You'll eventually make it a section that has a large "fin" on climbers left. Figure your way through this crux section that eventually leads you to rest. One more tricky section to go and then you'll be at the anchors.

# Location
Starts on Amazon Man.

# Protection
Fully bolted, a few perma-draws, anchor with 2 mussy hooks
