# Description
Thin technical start (crux) in a shallow dihedral gives way to good rests before a left-trending traverse under a roof on decent holds. Continue moving left through a small corner, around a massive flake, and up another small corner before ending at a two-bolt anchor on a ledge.

Things to consider: As with all new Jungle Cliff routes, Ecocide is a little dusty. The best way to clean it is to climb it. So climb it! Also, after the first 20 feet, this route continuously trends left to the anchors, making it tricky to clean when being lowered. It is advised if possible to clean via following the route.

# Location
Starts in a shallow dihedral under a roof, begins trending left after the third bolt

# Protection
Seven bolts to a two bolt anchor. All bolts 1/2", stainless steel, and perma-drawed.
