# Description
A stout alternate start to Oracle. Warlock ascends a gently overhanging prow with a distinct, powerful, unique crux.

This line was the inspiration for Micah Klesick to begin bolting new lines at the Jungle Cliff and recruiting others to take it on, setting off the recent wave of development.

After two bolts of moderate climbing, bust into a v9 boulder problem navigating the horn and a small crack/pocket, around the third bolt. From the giant jug at the end of the boulder problem, cut left and finish on the remainder of Oracle.

Still very dusty. Bring a brush.
