# Description
I found an unknown bolt line, turns out it's an abandoned Sowerby project. It splits off right from Slash and Burn at around mid height and busts through several tiered roofs.

I updated the  hardware with new stainless ASCA bolts, knocked off some loose blocks, left a fixed sling under one of the roofs, and chalked up a few holds. There is still cleaning to be done on it, although it lacks the layer of mud found on the right side of Jungle wall. As of 11/6/15 I still need to yank out the old bolts and patch the holes.

Some flakes came off of the Slash and Burn crux as well, so the lower portion may now be harder than it's original 12a rating.

From the look of it, this route will have several Vhard cruxes, including a horizontal dyno and possibly a bump to a shallow mono. It will make a worthy ascent for whoever gets up the thing. Have at it.

# Location
Breaks right off of Slash and Burn under a roof. Shares an anchor with a new closed project to the right.

# Protection
Shiny new bolts
