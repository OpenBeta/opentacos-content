# Description
The project is fully bolted, but needs a ton of cleaning. It should yield difficult, technical moves on vertical and gently overhanging terrain. I have a feeling the crux will be very sequential. The holds are small and the feet are scarce.

I probably wont get around to working this until several of my other projects get completed. If anyone is motivated to clean it off and give it a try, be my guest.

# Location
Climb the first 2 or 3 bolts of Oracle (I recommend using long runners here), then traverse left.

# Protection
Bolts.
