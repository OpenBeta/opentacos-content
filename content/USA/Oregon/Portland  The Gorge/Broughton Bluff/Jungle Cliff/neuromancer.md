# Description
An extension to mini-mancer that adds in some more movement at increased difficulty. Use the anchor for mini-mancer as another bolt. Continue moving up into a small corner crack. Navigate that and then move to the left to traverse a large block. Once on top of the block, you'll continue up a couple more bolts to the anchors.

# Location
Starts at the top of mini-mancer

# Protection
~5 bolts, 2 mussy hooks for the anchor
