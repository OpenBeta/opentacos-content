# Description
It's a juggy and ledgy climb that has a hard start. Recommend to stick clip the first bolt. The ledges look sketchy, but there are 4 bolts close together to protect falls over them. There are several ways to make your way up this line. Most of the clips can be made with a no-hands rest.

# Location
Left-most route on jungle cliff. The start is directly below a black bolt across from a big tree. Shares a first bolt with Welcome to the Jungle to the right.

# Protection
6 bolts to an achor with 2 mussy hooks
