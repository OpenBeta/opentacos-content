# Description
Full name: A Firestorm to Purify.

This route climbs directly up a steep, imposing roof with big moves on surprisingly good holds. Definitely a boulderer's sport route, requiring power, core tension, and even a virtual top out when you pull the lip.

Unfortunately, a key hold broke off shortly after I put the bolts in. The new crux sequence now goes left of the bolt line, meaning you'll take a swing if you blow it mid crux. It's a clean fall under a roof, but it adds a bit of commitment when working out the beta.

The route has cleaned up well, but it's the Jungle Cliff--bring a brush and be prepared to get a little dusty.

# Location
Obvious roof with fixed draws. To the left of Ecocide.

# Protection
Bolts. Fixed draws on the first several clips to aid cleaning. Shares the last bolt and anchor with Ecocide.
