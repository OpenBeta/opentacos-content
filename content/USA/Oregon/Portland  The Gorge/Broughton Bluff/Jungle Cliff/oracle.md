# Description
Oracle is an amazing line with powerful boulder problems, good rests, and (for me) some tricky kneebar wizardry. Shares the start with Necromancer, but heads straight up where Necromancer cuts right. The lower section is characterized by crimpy v2-3ish moves, then the difficultly kicks up for the last several bolts. Get it!

Thanks to Erik for bolting and cleaning this excellent route.

# Location
Shares the start with Necromancer.

# Protection
Fully bolted, a few perma-draws to help with cleaning and the crux clips. Anchors are 2 mussy hooks.
