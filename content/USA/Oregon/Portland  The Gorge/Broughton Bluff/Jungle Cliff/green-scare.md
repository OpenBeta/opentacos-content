# Description
Starting off the Ecocide anchors, this route follows a natural corner into a roof and ends at a nice ledge 5 feet to the right of the Necromancer anchor. Climb through a short bulge section to gain a good rest. From there, follow the corner underneath the roof. Clip the only fixed draw and navigate the roof section. From here, clip one more bolt to gain the ledge and the anchors.

From the top of Green Scare, one can continue straight up past 2 bolts to get to Skull Ledge and the beginning of Total Liberation. Alternatively, one can traverse left past two bolts and a bulge to gain the belay anchors for Enter The Void.
