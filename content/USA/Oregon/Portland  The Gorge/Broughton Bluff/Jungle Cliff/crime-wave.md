# Description
This interesting route is just left of Gorilla Love Affair, and shares the last bolt and the anchor of Gorilla Love Affair. This climb is actually well worth climbing. Climb up to where Gorilla Love Affair goes right, and with a few burly moves, gain the tight dihedral directly above. Then squirm your way up to good holds and easier moves to the shared finish.
