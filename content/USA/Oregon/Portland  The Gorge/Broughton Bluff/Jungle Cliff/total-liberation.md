# Description
Total Liberation offers steep, powerful climbing on an airy 2nd/3rd pitch off of Skull Ledge. The route mostly follows the original 3rd pitch of Amazon Man (new bolts replace the rusted out pins) to a new crux finish and an independent anchor.

A more difficult direct start may be possible.

# Location
Starts on Skull Ledge. This is best approached either via Necromancer (11d) or Ecocide/Green Scare (10d/10c) and continuing up two bolts to the obvious ledge.

# Protection
6 bolts. Currently has fixed draws on the first two bolts--to minimize the danger of decking on the ledge--and clip-in anchors.
