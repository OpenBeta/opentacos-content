# Description
Welcome to the Jungle is open for business. Its a bit dirty on some of the ledges and needs some bolts moved around for the 2 different finishes. The left finish, original finish, has changed some since the blocks came off. Still needs some cleaning. This keeps the route at low end 5.11

The right finish is considerable harder with a couple of difficult reaches and a burly top out bumps the grade closer to 5.12a.

# Location
Left side of Jungle cliff.  2nd route from the far left.  Shares first bolt with unfinished moderate on the left.

# Protection
9 lead bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with fixed biners for lowering.
