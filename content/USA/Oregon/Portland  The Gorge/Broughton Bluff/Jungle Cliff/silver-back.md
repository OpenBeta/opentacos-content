# Description
Silver Back follows the water streak up the far right side of Jungle Cliff and features three distinct cruxes that separate you from the anchors. Begin up the dirty dihedral to a steep, powerful bulge (the first clip is above this move so definitely stick clip it). Â Then, moderate, fun climbing takes you up the arete and to a good rest just before the headwall. Clip a bolt and do a series of lock-offs to a very powerful gaston move. Continue up the face on ever shrinking feet until you reach either the jug-bug or heartbreak. All draws have been replaced and it is clean and ready to climb!

# Location
Far right side, going through a wavy formation on the upper half.

# Protection
bolts
