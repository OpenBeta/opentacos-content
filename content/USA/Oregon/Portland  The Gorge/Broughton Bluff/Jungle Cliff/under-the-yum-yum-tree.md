# Description
A bouldery start that works its way up lower angle face features. After the crux the climbing eases up for a bit. The holds will start to get thin near the top but it's only a few moves away from the anchors.

# Location
The next line of bolts to the left of Tarzan. If you follow the wall to the left from Tarzan you'll start to walk uphill a bit. As soon as you get to this section is where the route starts.

# Protection
7 bolts and 2 mussy hooks for anchors. There is one perma-draw at the third bolt.
