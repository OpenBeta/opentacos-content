# Description
This amazing route punches straight up a overhanging face/arete on good holds, with a hard crux to start, and then up to a thin crux on the headwall  before the slab.

End the route at either the first set of anchors, or continue up through a really fun dynamic V3 crux just before the 2nd anchors.

# Location
Middle of the wall. Has fixed draws all the way up the route.

# Protection
Bolts with fixed draws
