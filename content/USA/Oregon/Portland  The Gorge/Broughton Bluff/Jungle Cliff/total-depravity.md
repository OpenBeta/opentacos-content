# Description
Quality new line on the Jungle Cliff.  It begins in a short and very enjoyable stem box, then immediately traverses right, finally pulling around the right side of the large roof and finishes on 10 feet of causal incut slab.  Total Depravity Involves some classic "Broughton" trickery, body contortion, and maybe a little blue collar grunting. Still a tad dirty but great none the less. 5.11 FUN!!! (getting close to 5.11+ range for those with shorter wing spans)

[stays dry most of the winter]

# Location
Far right side of Jungle cliff; just to the right of Forged in the Flames, starts in a stem box.

# Protection
Currently has fixed draws for the traverse (bring 2-3 quickdraws for the finish) and mussy hook anchor;

lower to the ground with your gym rope (but make sure you knot the end)
