# Description
Powerful, exposed roof climbing. Amazing position. It should clean up to be a 4 star line.

A technical dihedral leads to powerful undercling moves (the rock is more solid than it appears through this section). The route then splits at a double chain draw--the left variation is Micah Klesick's *closed project* and the original line. I equipped a 5 bolt variation to the right as an open project.

The grade is just a guess--it feels pretty hard to me. I took all the major loose flakes off, but beware some remaining loose rock.

# Location
Best approached by climbing Forced March, skipping some bolts and extending others to minimize drag. Cut left at the top of FM, placing a long draw on the anchor and entering the dihedral.

# Protection
Bolts and chain draws. *Mandatory 70m* to get to the ground, or lower twice.
