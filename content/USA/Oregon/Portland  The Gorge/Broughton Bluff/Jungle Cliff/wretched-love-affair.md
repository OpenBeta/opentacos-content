# Description
Climb the first three bolts of Gorilla Love Affair, then do a easy but unprotected traverse over the right slab into the top of Wretched of the Earth. Allows you to link fun cruxes of both routes, with moderate climbing in between. Worth doing!

Don't stop at the lower Heart of Darkness anchor. The WofE top crux continues for ~15ft to a higher anchor.

This might be PG-13. If it becomes a popular link-up, I'll add a bolt to protect the traverse. Or, if anyone else has the equipment and inclination to do it, FA permission is granted.

# Location
Do the crux of GLA and then head right over the slab and straight up the dihedral mid-section of WotE

# Protection
Bolts
