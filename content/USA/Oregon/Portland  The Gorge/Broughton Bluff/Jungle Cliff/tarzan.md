# Description
This amazing looking, and rather improbable looking route is quite prominent. Hard arete climbing to start, easing into a finishing slab to the shared anchors. Needs cleaning.

# Location
As you come down the trail to the main wall, this is the obvious bolted arete slab, just left of Gorilla Love Affair and Crime Wave.

# Protection
bolts
