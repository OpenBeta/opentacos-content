# Description
Gorilla Love Affair is a terrific climb on the left side of the Jungle Cliff.  It is unusually clean for a Jungle Cliff climb, possibly due to its (relative) popularity.  G.L.A. offers several strenuous but fun cruxes which are separated by good rests.  A small cam can be placed after the last bolt before transitioning left onto the finishing slab (although the remaining climbing is fairly casual).

# Location
Left side of the Jungle Cliff.

# Protection
bolts and an optional #2 C3
