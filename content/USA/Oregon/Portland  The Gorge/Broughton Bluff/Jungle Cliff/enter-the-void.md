# Description
This route starts about 100 feet off the ground and heads up a slab over the enormous roof on the upper left side of the Jungle Cliff. The route is characterized by an extremely airy start to technical finesse moves on side-pulls and crimps up an 80 degree slab. The crux features thin, delicate moves with marginal feet. Though this route is relatively short, it feels pretty adventurous and gripping for the location and grade.

# Location
The route starts on top of the Wretched of the Earth Extension. It then heads up the slab that caps the major roof on the left side of the wall. To get down, rap or lower from the top anchors to the belay anchor. From there, a 70-meter rope is needed to get you to the ground.

# Protection
Two bolt belay anchor to four bolts finishing with another two bolt anchor with rap rings. All bolts are 3/8" stainless steel.
