# Description
Twist & Crawl is a completely ignored though decent climb.  Maybe the replacement of several nasty bolts and a new anchor with breathe life into this climb.

Start in a dihedral that ends on a short section of slab.  At the slab, negotiate a small bulge and you'll be rewarded with a decent stance on a ramp.  Work your way right and into another short dihedral.  At this point the route gets steeper and the climbing gets burly.  Deadpoint to a flat edge on the arÃªte, pull-up into the steep crack above and layback up to the anchor.

Taming Twist & Crawl takes a full bag of climbing tricks.  There are several cruxes, each being quite different in style.
