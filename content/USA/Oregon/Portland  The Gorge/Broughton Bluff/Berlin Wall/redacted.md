# Description
One of the most consistently steep routes at Broughtons, Closet Nazi offers powerful, exciting climbing.  Relative straight forward for the grade, and for a Broughton's route, it is a good 5.12 if you're just getting into the grade.  Once through the mid-section the business is over, but the pump might make you fail near the top.

# Location
Berlin Wall, first route on left.

# Protection
Sport.
