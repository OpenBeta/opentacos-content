# Description
So there you are looking at a wall covered in 2" thick moss and you say "Hey, I think I want to climb that." If this sounds like you then this route is definitly for you. The movement on this route is straight forward ( I did this with an old pair of trail runners) and the pro isn't terrible. The route wouldn't be that bad if someone wanted to go through the effort of cleaning all the moss off the route. One more thing to include is that there is a terrible thorn monster midway up the route. He ate both me and my partner. If you see him, please slay the dreadful thing. Fat bolts await the amazing climber directly above the main block.

# Location
This route runs up a meandering crack along the right side of the obvious block sticking out from the middle of the wall.

# Protection
Pro to 2"
