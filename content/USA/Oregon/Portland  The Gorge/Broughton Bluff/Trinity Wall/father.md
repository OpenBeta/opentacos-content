# Description
Father (get it...trinity wall) begins with some thin slab climbing to get establish in the Right facing corner where you'll find your first good piece of protection. continue up the corner before heroically pulling through the roof onto the slab above.  Save a small cam (I placed a blue metolius) to protect the initial moves on the slab.  The Climb then finishes on fun 5.9+ face climb clipping two shiny bolts and then a new anchor.

# Location
center left of the trinity wall

# Protection
gear to 1" and two bolts
