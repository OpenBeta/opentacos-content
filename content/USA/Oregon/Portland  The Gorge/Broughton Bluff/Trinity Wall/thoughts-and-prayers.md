# Description
Thoughts and Prayers requires a variety of climbing techniques.  Begin under the ominous (apparently free hanging?) pillar on the right of the main slab.  Once established in the #4 crack, use butterflys or fist jams and stemming to inch your way up to the mini roof.  Pull yourself up to the stance above.  Now place some pro to your left (blue metolius) in the fracture under the massive semi-attached flake.  The Climb cuts left using under clings, hero jugs and sticky smears.  Join up with the neighboring routes and finish straight up the fun face clipping two bolts on your way to the anchor.

Thoughts and Prayers aren't going to hold those scary flakes in place.  Please exercise caution.  I did take a 4 foot crowbar to them, and nothing appeared to be loose.

# Location
center right of the wall, starts under the free hanging pillar

# Protection
an assortment of pieces.  #4 BD for the start, two bolts up top.
