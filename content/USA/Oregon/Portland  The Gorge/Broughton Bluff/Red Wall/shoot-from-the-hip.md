# Description
With a technical start and a powerful middle, Shoot From the Hip offers a little bit of everything.  The crux comes roughly half way up the climb, just past the first clip and requires a strenuous lock-off and dynamic move.  However, the delicate start or the tricky top section could cause you to fall too.

# Location
On the right side of Red Wall, just right of Hard Body.

# Protection
Bolts and small cams or nuts for the start.
