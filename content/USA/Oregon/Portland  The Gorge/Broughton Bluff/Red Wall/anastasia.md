# Description
A short, popular TR with an interesting flare section.  This route sees a lot of traffic, probably due to the ease of setting it up as a Top-rope.   Climb a slabby section following edges & thin crack to a good stance below the obvious flaring pod.  The crux sequence up & through the pod can be tough to figure out at first, but after figuring out the moves, this is easy for 5.9 and over quickly.   After the pod a few more easy moves take you to the anchor.

# Location
On the far left side or Red Wall - just above where the trail emerges at the wall - it's the obvious flare about 20' left of classic crack. To set a TR, scramble up the "trail" (loose and dirty slope) to the left from the base of the climb, and then move back around to the right to reach the ledge by wiggling over & behind a boulder (3rd/4th class?).

# Protection
Normally Top-roped.

Gear placements on lead are sparse and marginal, so not really recommended to lead this on your first time.
