# Description
very short but interesting top-rope set up to the left of classic crack.  Ascend via two thin crack seams up over a boulder and to the ledge at the anchors. Crimpy, balancey and a good short climb on the Red Wall at Broughton Bluff.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Best to be top-roped, scramble up the trail at the left of the wall to a decent ledge at the top of Classic Crack and the other climbs.  Anchor at the classic crack anchors and run a directional to reduce the possibility of swinging.
