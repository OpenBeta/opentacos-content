# Description
This route lies between Red Eye and Critical Mass.  It ascends up a skiny black streak, using edges and slopers.  The crux comes just after the second clip and consists of a hard sloper move, but some tricky crimps just before are hard too.  Approach from Thai Stick or Mr. Bentley and clip the bolt left of the Thai Stick anchors or the anchors themselves.  The next bolt is a bit spooky and hard to clip.  Finish the route to the Red Eye anchors or into Kashmir.  There is a piton between the last bolt and the Red Eye anchors.

# Location
The route is located on the Red Wall, just above Thai Stick.

# Protection
Bolts. The old, terrifying bolt was recently replaced with a SS 1/2" bolt. The old bolt is still there until we can get a saw out to cut it out, but there is a new one next to it to use.
