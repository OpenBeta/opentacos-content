# Description
This route was bolted by Charlie Egan. It begins from the anchors of Sheer Stress and then cuts up and slightly right. The main climbing starts off a long rail system just below a short face. Commence up the boulder problem, using the left hand arete and small side-pulls/underclings with the right. Then go big...big, big, big. The hard climbing ends at the Pinhead rail. Â The natural finish is the one that Charlie added, and climbing the Pinhead finish doesn't add to the difficulty. Another great line by Charlie - Whoop!

# Location
Route right of Pinhead. Begin up Sheer Stress (trad)

# Protection
Trad gear for Sheer Stress. Bolts the rest of the way
