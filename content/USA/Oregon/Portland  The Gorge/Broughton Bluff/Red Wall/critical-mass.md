# Description
Critical Mass starts with the 5.10a face/crack Sheer Stress (the holds on this section are

polished

so it's a bit trickier than it'd normally be).  From the anchors continue up and right past six more bolts to an anchor.  The crux comes 2/3 of the way to the top at a large bulge.  I found all of the clipping stances to be a bit reachy although with quickdraws hung they would be much better.

This route feels like a series of linked boulder problems, in that there are a few tricky sections followed by excellent rests.

The top of the climb ends with a fun series of slab moves and you can continue up the final pitch of Red Eye (5.10c) to the top of the wall.

# Location
In the middle of the Red Wall.  Start at the bolt line a few feet climber's left of the tree in the middle of the wall.

# Protection
Quickdraws and a 60m rope are really all that's needed, although I found a place for a yellow Alien near the bottom; a couple of pieces of this size might be good for piece of mind.  There are 3 bolts before the intermediate anchors and then 6 more before reaching the top.
