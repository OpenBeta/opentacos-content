# Description
This is just the description for the first pitch, which is 3 bolts and graded 5.10a. It starts just above Anastasia (5.9 TR), with your first bolts being the anchor for the top rope on Anastasia.

Climb up on good holds through 3 bolts of climbing through steep rock with plenty of jugs! Climb up until you are even with the Red Eye anchors, and then traverse hard right onto the ledge the Red Eye anchors are on.

Really fun climbing, and well worth doing. We scrambled up around as if setting up a TR, and then dropped the rope down to the belayer and lead the route from there. Follower can climb up one of the TR routes into it.

# Location
Just above Anastasia, and left of Red Eye, goes to Red Eye P1 anchors.

# Protection
3 bolts, plus anchors.
