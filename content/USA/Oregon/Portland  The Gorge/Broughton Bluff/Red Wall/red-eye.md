# Description
Red Eye is an extremely fun and popular route.  It climbs the head wall just above Classic Crack (it can be approached by Classic Crack, Thai Stick, or the walk up approach) and passes through cool huecos, using powerful moves to gain a ledge--the crux.  The anchors are on an obvious ledge up left.

The route can be continued up higher (though it is seldom done) by moving right from the anchors and up a blocky section towards Kashmir's first bolt.  From here, stay right and climb the obvious dihedral and crack to the top.  It is roughly 60 feet to the second anchor station. The rock is solid, but dirty, and the climbing is solid 5.10.

# Location
Red Eye is on the Red Wall, just above Classic Crack.

# Protection
First pitch: bolts to bolted anchor.

Second pitch: gear to BD #2.
