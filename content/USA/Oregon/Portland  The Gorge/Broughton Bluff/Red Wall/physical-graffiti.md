# Description
Wow!  This is a true trad tick.  Physical Graffiti starts with fun, but tricky face climbing which then leads to the cool overhang near the top with a zig-zag crack splitting the middle.  A difficult exit over the roof holds many sequences; find yours.

# Location
Red Wall, left side

# Protection
Trad, with some bolts on Habitual Ritual
