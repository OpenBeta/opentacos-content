# Description
The awesome toprope problem just to the left of Sheer Stress.  Powerful, technical moves make this climb more like a tall boulder problem.  Just getting your feet off the ground is a challenge, and it gets harder from there!  Ascend using low friction slopers and sidepulls and very bad feet until you finally reach a "real hold" about fifteen feet up, at which point the difficulties become more manageable.

# Location
Five feet to the left of Sheer Stress on the Red Wall.

# Protection
Toprope problem.  Easily TR'ed from the anchors for Thai Stick.  Apparently this has been bouldered/soloed, but with a bad landing and committing finish it would be a very serious undertaking.
