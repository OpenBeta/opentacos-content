# Description
This route packs in easy crack climbing, a bouldery roof, and a slab into a compact 50 feet.  Start on the leaning columns (the cracks here eat small to medium nuts) and move up to a roof sequence protected by two bolts.  Pull through the roof on good holds to the slab above, which provides 10 more feet of climbing to the anchors.

# Location
On the far right side of the Red Wall.  Look for an arcing line of columns up to the bolted roof.

# Protection
Small to medium nuts, two quickdraws.
