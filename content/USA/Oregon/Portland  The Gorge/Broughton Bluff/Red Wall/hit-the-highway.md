# Description
Hit the Highway has many approaches, but the best way is to link either Classic Crack or Thai Stick into Red Eye and then into Hit the Highway.  Once you reach the anchors of Red Eye you move up as if into Kashmir, but head left into the obvious overhanging dihedral.  From Red Eye's anchors all of  Hit the Highway is trad climbing.  Once you reach the end of the stemming dihedral you can exit left and to the anchors just before the overhang of physical graffiti (fairly burly move) or you can head up right and follow a dirty, flaring, and blocky section to the actual anchors of Hit the Highway.  Both ways are about the same grade, but offer different hard moves.

# Location
Red Wall.

# Protection
Sport and Trad.
