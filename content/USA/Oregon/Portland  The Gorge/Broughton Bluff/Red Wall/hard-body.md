# Description
A technical route with a demanding and interesting crux, Hard Body offers continuous climbing with little rest until the chains are clipped.  Like the name implies, you had better be a hard body, for the crux requires some body tension.  P.S. It is said that climbing this route in 80's style lycra will do you good.

# Location
