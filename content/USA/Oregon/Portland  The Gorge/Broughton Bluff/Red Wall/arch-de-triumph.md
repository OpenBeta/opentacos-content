# Description
Use stressful hand and fist jams to make progress up the dusty arch. One big move about half way up leads to easier climbing afterwards. The climb is rated 5.7 in the Olson guidebook, but I think it deserves a little more than that.

# Location
The obvious right-facing/right-arching crack on the far left side of the Red Wall.

# Protection
Pro to 5"
