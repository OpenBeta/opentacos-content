# Description
This short but "classic" crack has purportedly become harder over the years due to glossing from continuous traffic.  Nevertheless it is still a great climb with quality moves.  A nice feature of this climb is the overhanging rock above it protects the climb from rain.

The climb begins on a small platform.  Ascend a wide crack that quickly narrows to finger size.  Top out using the crack or traverse left onto face holds.

Rappel or do 5.1 walk off to the left.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Single set of cams with doubles in the finger sizes. Nice big chains at top.
