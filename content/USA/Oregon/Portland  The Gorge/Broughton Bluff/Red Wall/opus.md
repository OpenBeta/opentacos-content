# Description
A bouldery climb that takes on the face between Sheer Stress and Sheer Energy. Easy column climbing leads to the first bolt and the start of the crux. Clip the first bolt with a single carabiner and ask your belayer to keep the slack to a minimum. The climbing off of the column is very bouldery and stout. After the second bolt, fun 5.10 climbing is all that's left.
