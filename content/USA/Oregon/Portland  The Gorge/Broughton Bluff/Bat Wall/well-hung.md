# Description
An "original" Bat Wall Route, from '77, recently updated and now a safe-er sport climb.

Starting on top of the small boulder, commence with a difficult section (many will find the crux) getting past the first bolt. Move towards the "magically suspended" flake in the roof, monkey past it, over the roof and dive into the flare. Catch your breath and do a final move up and left, stopping at the anchors for Mystic Void.

# Location
Begins on top of small boulder 10 feet to the right of Mystic Void.

Just right of the boulder is a good spot to belay.

# Protection
5 Lead Bolts (6 if you clip the final bolt of Mystic Void). Shares anchors with Mystic Void, mussy hooks.
