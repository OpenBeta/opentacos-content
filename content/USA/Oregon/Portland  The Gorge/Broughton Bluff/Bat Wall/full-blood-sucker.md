# Description
From the anchors of Blood Sucker, continue up the dihedral for a few easy moves until forced to move right around the arete. Deceptive body position and use of bad compression holds are the name of the game here, a common theme at Bat Wall. While the difficult transition onto the arete is probably the crux (permachain), the big power moves from flake to flake and the final heave over the bulge to the anchors will send many a flamed traveler flying!

# Location
Directly above the anchors of Blood Sucker

# Protection
5 bolts extension, 10 bolts total (from the ground). 1 perma chain. Mussy Hooks at anchors.
