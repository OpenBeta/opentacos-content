# Description
Dracula is one of the best and most popular 5.12 routes in Portland.  The route is consistent, but the ending (into the infamous Pod)could get you any time.  Good, unique, and classic moves fill the route.  A truly addicting classic.

# Location
The third bolt line on the Batwall. A loose, but wedged nalgene-sized chockstone (often with an 'X' chalked on it) helps identify the start.

# Protection
Sport.
