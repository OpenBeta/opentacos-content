# Description
Excellent new route on the far right side of the Bat Wall. Start up the easy columns to a high first bolt. A few tricky moves of Broughton slab puts you beneath the obvious, steep right facing corner system. Power up the corner using mostly good holds until its possible to step right (fixed chain) out of the corner and onto the steep face above. Get a good shake if you can and battle your way past the crux pocket and the steep pumper jug finish! It ain't over till you clip the chains!

# Location
Starts on a broken column that leads up a couple bolts of slab.

# Protection
12 Bolts and Anchors with Mussy Hooks. Fixed permachain halfway up.
