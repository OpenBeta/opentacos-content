# Description
This line starts just left of Bad Omen, goes up two bolts, and then cuts right across Bad Omen into an angling fist crack that ends at the first pitch Superstition anchor. The crux is the first 25'. You can ease the route to 5.11+ by going up the first 4 bolts of Bad Omen and then cutting right into the hand crack to the anchor. (Also a more direct route.)

# Location
A couple feet left of Bad Omen.

# Protection
Fully bolted
