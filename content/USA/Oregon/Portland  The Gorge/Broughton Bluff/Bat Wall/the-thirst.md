# Description
Fun climb that rarely gets done, starts at the far right side of the Bat wall near a fallen tree and a large boulder (see photo).

This route deserves more traffic and is a nice break from the conventional bat wall style. The first couple bolts follow a thin steam (the start of Dave Sowerby's OG route- "The Hunger") This section requires some techy trady finesse (climb smarter, not harder). I found this to be the technical crux- it's really unique and fun.  At the third bolt hand traverse hard left with an absence of feet ("The Hunger" heads right, following an arching crack)  The redpoint crux comes high at the last bolt where you're likely to feel fatigued and need to commit to some big moves.  Lower off mussy hooks which are not visible until the last bolt (not shared with Tomb Raider as it may appear from ground)
