# Description
A powerful start, thought-provoking middle and pumpy top define this layer-cake of a climb. This is a 5 bolt, direct start to Count Chalkula. Another Bat Wall gem!

# Location
The route starts just left of Dracula. At the second bolt, the Undercount shares the no-hands rest with Dracula and moves left. The top 3 bolts are shared with Count Chalkula.

# Protection
8 quickdraws
