# Description
The crux of this route comes at the start, just above the first bolt.  A long deadpoint, bad feet, and crazy slaps with tense body positions make the crux a great test piece. (A good hand jam helps ease the crux!)  Clip the second bolt just after the deadpoint, but it's not quite done until a little higher.  The route gets little traffic, but it is solid and fun.  A second crux comes up high, where you must mantle mantle mantle and then traverse left into the finish roof of bloodline.  The direct start is way spooky, but if you have spare undies then go for it.
