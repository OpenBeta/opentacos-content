# Description
Fun route, involving powerful and reachy moves through a roof. Often overlooked due to the abundance of classic 5.12s on the Bat Wall, but a worthy route nonetheless.

The original line starts on Superstition and cuts right before the slab crux of that route. You can also climb into it from Lost Boys, which seems like the more natural line. The 'heart' of the route is the cruxy roof, so it shouldn't make too much difference either way.

# Location
Either head right before the crux of Superstition or climb straight up before the upper crux of Lost Boys.

# Protection
Bolts
