# Description
A quality line that has been rebolted recently. Step off the Superstition belay ledge and over the abyss. Once established on the wall, long reaches off decent crimps will take you to a good rest. Pull the roof on jugs to reach the anchors. Airy climbing. Good!

# Location
Head left from the anchors of the first pitch of Superstition.

# Protection
SS bolts and steel biners at anchors as of 1/16.
