# Description
Climb the first four bolts of Frightnight, then traverse right just below the crux of Bad Oman, finishing on that pitch. More of a direct line than finishing on Bela, and just as quality.

# Location
Starts to the right of Bela Legosi and to the left of The Haunting.

# Protection
Bolts
