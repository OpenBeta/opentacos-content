# Description
This was bolted in hopes of finding a fun moderate for the bat wall. It's not the most fun and the start of the route is much harder than the rest of the climbing. It's some more rock to climb at least and the style is a little different than the other routes on the wall.

Start in the dihedral below the first bolt. Smear and stem your way up till you get below the small roof. Use the finger crack or some other options to move above the roof. Continue up on easier terrain. You'll do some fun vert moves that will lead you to the anchors.

# Location
This is the last route on the right side of the wall before you get to a blank section of no routes. Further down the wall there are a few more.

# Protection
Bolts with mussy hooks at the anchors.
