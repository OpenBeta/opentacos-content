# Description
Frigtnight offers desperate climbing between good shakes.  The technical crux comes just above the third bolt, involving big moves off very small crimps.  However, two large lockoffs above and a tricky sequence just before the crux make the route quite pumpy.  From the fifth bolt move left into the finish of Bela Lugosi.  The rating given applies to this finish (the direct finish is much harder).  All in all, Frightnight offers great moves, good position, and solid rock.

# Location
On the Batwall, just right of Bela Legosi.

# Protection
Bolts.  A long runner can be placed on the fifth bolt to protect the longest runout on the climb, making it relatively safe.  However, without this you may take a long fall onto the fourth bolt and the route will be quite scary.
