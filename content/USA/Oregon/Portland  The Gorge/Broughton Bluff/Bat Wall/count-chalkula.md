# Description
Climb the first 5 or 6 bolts of Dracula, then cut left into more difficult territory. Classic Broughton--the holds wouldn't be so bad if any of them faced the right direction.

The grade applies to the first anchor, the extension is much harder. It looks as though a hard direct start (straight up after the  second bolt of Drac) was once bolted and then chopped--not sure on the story there. If anyone manages to link those moves on toprope and thinks its a viable alternate start, PM me and I'll be happy to re-equip it.

# Location
Start on Dracula, cut left.

# Protection
Bolts. You may want to extend the 5th bolt of  Dracula (and 6th if you clip it) to reduce drag.
