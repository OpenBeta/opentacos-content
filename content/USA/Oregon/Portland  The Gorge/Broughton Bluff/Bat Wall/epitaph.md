# Description
An excellent new route on the Bat Wall. Epitaph opens with a rad problem ~V6 that involves catching sloping rails with marginal feet. The second crux offers long lock-offs off good crimps. A final slab with small edges protects the anchors. The three sections are separated by good rests. This climb is well worth the approach.

Starts with a shallow left hand pocket and right sloper.

# Location
This route starts on the upper right section of the of the Bat Wall. This climb can be approached by climbing up and past the second pitch of Superstition. A 2" cam can be used to protect a small run out. The climb starts on a large ledge.

# Protection
5 bolts + anchors with rap rings. Stainless steel. A 70M rope will get you to the ground with rope stretch using the LOWER ANCHORS.
