# Description
A super climb that involves extremely technical climbing, an explosive move up high, and a final exit into the "pod."  Why it doesn't see more ascents is baffling, for it is one of the coolest climbs on the Bat Wall.

Starts just right of Dracula.

# Location
Bat Wall

# Protection
Well bolted sport route.

(NEW BOLTS

have replaced the old rusty bolts.)
