# Description
This is really fun! And it's a great workout! And it's worthwhile. Even if you are going out solo and find no one to belay you and left all your gear in the car so that aiding is out, it is a fun, pumpy, and worthwhile climb.  The final moves, which take you across the beginning of Dance Macabre and through Bloodline, are the crux sequences and the most powerful moves on the climb, but there is a nice technical crux just right of Bad Omen.  By far the best "boulder problem" in the Portland area...it's more than 35 moves! Who would argue?  Fun, fun, fun.

# Location
Start at Dracula and traverse right until you get to Superstition.

# Protection
None. Bouldering.
