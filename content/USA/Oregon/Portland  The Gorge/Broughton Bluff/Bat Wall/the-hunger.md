# Description
Start by stepping off the Large boulder at the far far right side of the Bat Wall, follow the thin seam for 10-15 feet (note the hand jam half way up).  Rather than following bolts head right and follow the cracks and seams and gear.  apparently there is a bolt near the top before the anchors (might need to be replaced).

# Location
far far right side of the bat wall (starts by stepping off a large boulder)
