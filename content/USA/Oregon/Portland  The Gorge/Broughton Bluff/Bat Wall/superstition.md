# Description
Superstition

is a three pitch line that goes to the top of the Bat Wall. Only the first pitch is described here. OlsonÂ’'s

Portland Rock Climbs

has information on the complete line if so desired.

P1 of

Superstition

is a popular and fun climb near the center of the Bat Wall (just left of

Lost Boys

). Ascend a shallow corner passing several minor cruxes. Near the top of the pitch, a leftward traverse on a slab needs to be negotiated (crux). Once past the slab, move up into the flaring chimney. Directly above you'll see the anchors.
