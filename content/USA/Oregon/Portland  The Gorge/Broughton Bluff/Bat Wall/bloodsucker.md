# Description
I don't think this one receives much attention, but it's stout little crux makes for a solid climb. Although it is quite short and shares a hold or two with Bloodline, it is surprisingly fun. The difficulties are very brief but fairly intense and consist of a couple bouldery moves followed by a balancy lean just above the first bolt. Fun route. Do it.

# Location
One route left of bloodline

# Protection
Three bolts and an anchor
