# Description
A wandering new linkup that connects Mystic Void into Lost Boys, effectively skips the low crux of Lost Boys. Start up Mystic Void but skip the last bolt before the anchors. Step hard left instead (long draws/slings helpful), and make an airy traverse over to join Lost Boys just after its 4th (crux) bolt. From here continue up Lost Boys to its anchors.

# Location
Starts on Mystic Void, Finishes on Lost Boys.

# Protection
11 bolts total. Shares bolts with Mystic Void and Lost Boys.

Uses Lost Boys anchors (mussy hooks).

Long draws or slings are helpful to reduce drag.
