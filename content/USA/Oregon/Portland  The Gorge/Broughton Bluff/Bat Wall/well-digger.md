# Description
A great linkup and probably the best, most direct way to get to the upper climbing on Grave Digger. Start up Well Hung (helpful to stick clip the 3rd bolt from standing on the starting boulder...this will save you on rope drag at the top). After pulling the roof, clip a bolt up and right but continue climbing towards the Mystic Void anchors. Step right away from the corner crack and out onto a vertical face with a few small holds. Clip another bolt and make a few difficult, long reaches on small crimps and cracks to gain the dirty ledge and jugs under the main dihedral of Grave Digger. The linkup section probably clocks in at 5.11-. Continue up Grave Digger to its lower anchors at 100' (60m rope) or past the 2 bolt extension to 115' (70m rope required)

# Location
Directly above Well Hung. Links up into the obvious dihedral on Grave Digger.

# Protection
15 bolts to lower set of anchors on Grave Digger (mussy hooks) at 100'.
