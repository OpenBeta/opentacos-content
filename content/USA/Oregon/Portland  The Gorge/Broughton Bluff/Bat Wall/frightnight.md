# Description
The original Frightnight Route.

First climbed by the visiting climber Matthias Pausch in 1991.

Over the years the route has had two easier variations added (Bite Night & Fright Lite) that escape onto neighboring routes to the right and left respectively.  The direct and original finish climbs straight up through two bolts (one drilled pin) to the right of "the pod" via a technical and fierce boulder problem.

Get after it!
