# Description
Start up Superstition clipping its first 3 bolts. Then step left and climb up the corner scoop feature until forced to make a difficult move to gain a stance under the small roof. Climb over the roof using the hanging flake feature moving up and left (crux). This will deposit you under the big finish roof of Blood Line. From here step right around the roof using mostly big holds and bad feet to a stance below the final bulge to the anchors.

# Location
Bat Wall, right side. Starts on Superstition, then cuts left.

# Protection
8 bolts total. Shares Anchors with Blood Line (mussy hooks)
