# Description
This short route can be a decent warm up for Lost Boys or Superstition if those are your project routes. Climb either straight up from below the first bolt (just right of Lost Boys) or start on Lost Boys, and then traverse right from the first bolt. Then continue up the dihedral, placing good gear until you can pull onto the right face and finish the last couple moves to the anchor at the Maple tree growing out of the cliff.

# Location
Last route on the Bat Wall that is typically climbed. Look for the maple tree growing out of the cliff at about 35' off the ground. Just right of Lost Boys.

# Protection
gear to 1", and one or two bolts.
