# Description
This obvious steep, right angling crack feature sat dormant and covered with jungle for many years. Recently unearthed and equipped with bolts (I left many of the old fixed pieces of protection in place for historical context), Gold Arch joins near the top of the ranks amongst a wall already stacked with excellent 5.12s. Bring your crack skills for this one!

Start either on Grave Digger for the first 4 bolts (5.11- and probably best way) or on the original Gold Arch start (which is a few feet left of Dark Arts, 5.11-, and a bit less classic) to gain a good stance below a steep flaring corner system. Tackle the difficult roof (crux) past the fixed draw to gain a stance and access to the elegant right angling finger crack. Finish with tricky moves to a good ledge and anchors at 65'.

Or for extra points skip the first set of anchors and head up and left and link into the original 2nd pitch of Gold Arch for 40 more feet and 6 bolts of excellent climbing (5.11c). The full route, Gold Arch p1 and p.2 combined, is called "Full Gold" and stops right at the 100' mark. Watch your ends on a 60m rope.
