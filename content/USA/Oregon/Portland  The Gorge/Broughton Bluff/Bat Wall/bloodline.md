# Description
This striking and powerful line is one the best on the Bat wall.  Containing power, balance, and finesse this route is a masterpiece.  The opening moves are the hardest but upper moves still pack a punch.  Begin up a very steep start below the remenants of a massive old beehive.  This hive was removed long ago to reveal several very nice sharp incuts. (Route is also known a B-line or Beeline due to this)  Continue up through a series of changing corners up to a huge roof.  Traverse the roof and pull the lip on the left side.  There are nice chain anchors just above the roof on a ledge.

The route is well bolted and was solely a sport climb up until a few years ago when several locals did the Retro-trad ascent.  No bolts were removed but the entire route was done on gear.  A trad ascent of the route is a spicy endeavor and should probably be rehearsed on TR or on bolts first.
