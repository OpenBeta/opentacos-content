# Description
Excellent new test-piece on the Bat Wall. This route requires both power and finesse as you navigate a very thin traverse and a large "windshield wiper" move off a sharp crimp sidepull to decent holds above.

Nosferatu veers left after the first bolt of Manson. For maximum quality, approach it as an extension to Bad Oman through the new link up bolts.

Thanks to Gary Rall for tipping me off to this line, and congrats to Matt for bagging it.

Bolts. Currently has chain draws. 70m rope is mandatory to get down in one lower. If using a 60m, pull your rope at the Dracula anchor and lower twice.
