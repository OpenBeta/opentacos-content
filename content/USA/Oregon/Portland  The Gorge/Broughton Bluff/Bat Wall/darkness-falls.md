# Description
This route provides a harder finish to Dark Arts. Start on Dark Arts and continue up the steep dihedral until you reach the perma chain draw. Clip it and head left past 2 more perma chains and a tough crux move on small holds to a good stance beneath the anchors for Gold Arch. Step right past a tricky move to incut flakes and a relatively easy finish.

# Location
Start on Dark Arts but cut left at the first permadraw.

# Protection
13 bolts (total) and 3 perma chains, anchors with mussy hooks at the top.
