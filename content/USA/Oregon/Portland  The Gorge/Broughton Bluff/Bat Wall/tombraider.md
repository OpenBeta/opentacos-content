# Description
Begin ambling up and Left three bolts of moderate terrain in the low 5.10 range.  Pull the bulge which clocks in around 5.11-.  At bolt 6 you may want to cut a little Left of the bolt line where the holds seem to make the most sense.

Crux comes at the second to last bolt and its very apparently the crux. plan your sequence and get a good look at which holds you gonna end up using.

Tombraider is probably the best 5.11 on the bat wall (with the exception of Vampyr).  Though its still a tad dirty this thing is worth your time.

# Location
Far right side of the bat wall (like I mean, farrrr right side).  starts by a large fallen log and a couple large bolders.

# Protection
like 8 or 9 bolts
