# Description
This short route packs quite a punch getting up into a deep "pod". Begin up bouldery moves to a small jug, then make very long, strenuous moves requiring solid body tension and good footwork. Then launch into burly sidepulling and crimping until you can get to a hidden pocket in the pod and pull up into. The hardest climbing is done at this point, but don't let your guard down just yet..

# Location
Directly underneath Bloodline. Look for an anchor 40' up and 3 bolts going just inside a large "pod" like dihedral.

# Protection
3 bolts
