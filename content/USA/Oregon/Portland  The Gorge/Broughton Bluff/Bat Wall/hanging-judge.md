# Description
Climb up large easy blocks to a good stance below an obvious right trending corner crack system. A couple of tricky lay back moves (some folks might find a jam or two helpful) and you are into the business. Power through the final steep bulge with mostly good edges and killer finger locks to a good ledge with anchors.

# Location
Far left side of Bat Wall. Starts 25 feet left of Dracula

# Protection
5 bolts, anchors with mussy hooks
