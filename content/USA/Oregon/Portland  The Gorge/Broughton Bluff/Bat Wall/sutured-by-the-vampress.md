# Description
A great addition to the Bat Wall, Sutured by the Vampress follows Manson Family to the bolt after the crux and then cuts right through two more bolts. Head up into the beautiful, thin seam via an initial bolt of juggy and fun climbing. Then things get hard.  The crux of the route is getting to the anchors, figuring out the seam, slopers, and where to set your right hand before a good-old lunge.  Sutured offers a much more exciting finish than MFR and is just as quality -  Great position and great rock, with intricate moves.

# Location
Follow Manson Family and cut right just after clipping the bolt past the crux.

# Protection
Bolts.
