# Description
Ascend good holds to the first bolt before making your way up into the left facing, thin hands corner. Traverse left under the dark shadows of the looming roof, and then work further left to clip a second bolt on a blank face. After some rumination of how to pull through this crux, fire it and romp your way up good holds to the mussy hooks!

# Location
Far right side of Bat Wall. Look for the huge roof above the left facing corner.

# Protection
3 bolts, gear to #0.75 BD, including micro cams and small nuts. Mussy hooks to lower off.
