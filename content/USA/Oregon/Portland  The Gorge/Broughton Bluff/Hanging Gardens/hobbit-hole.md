# Description
Yet another variation start to the first pitch of Hanging Gardens. The Hobbit Hole is like nothing else you'll do at Broughton Bluff. Start by ducking under and into the detached dihedrals just to the right of the Hanging Gardens direct start. The hardest section is at the beginning due to the tightness of the chimney and the lack of light. Wiggle your way up about twenty feet until you pop out of the chimney and into the light at which point you’ll be just below the p1 anchor. The Hobbit Hole is readily protectable although I think that most will forgo protection.
