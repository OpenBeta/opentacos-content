# Description
Start with any of the left/ center first-pitch alternatives for Hanging Gardens, and about 45 ft up trends left toward the left slanting crack protected by two bolts visible from the ground. The second of those protects the finish of Slapfest and is the crux going this route, finishing at the second anchor for Loose Block Overhang.

With the bolts protecting the crux, this route may well feel easier than Loose Block Overhang, certainly commitment-wise, and is a great choice to get a top rope up for your Slapfest shenanigans.

Usually climbed to here in one pitch, but mind your rope line/ drag. Lower off or belay and continue to top via the 5.8 third pitch of Loose Block Overhang and walk off.

# Location
The 5.6 wide crack beginning option to Hanging Gardens is probably the most direct start.

# Protection
Lower gear varies according to alternative starting option. BD .3-1 and two bolts from midway.
