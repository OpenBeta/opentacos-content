# Description
Pretty easy route, well described by the name.  Could be a decent route for learning to place Trad protection.  Can also have a top rope set from the path around the back.  For a longer route, some folks set a top-rope on the Edges and Ledges anchors but start on Giant's Staircase and then traverse to the right when they can't go vertical any further (this would give it a 5.8 finish).

# Location
Left-most route on the left half of Hanging Gardens Wall (just to the left of Edges and Ledges).

# Protection
Anchors at top.  Pro to 2".
