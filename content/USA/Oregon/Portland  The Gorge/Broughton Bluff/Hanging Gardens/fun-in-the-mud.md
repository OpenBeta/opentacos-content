# Description
This mixed climbs starts up past 3 bolts on slabby ground, to underneath a bulging roof that's broken by a thin crack.   Takes pro after reaching the bulge, and through the roof crux.   After an exciting move up & over the bulge, continue up past 1 more bolt and over another bulge by heading to the right, then traverse back left to reach the anchor bolts  (shared with From Something to Nothing).

The slabby section above the crux roof can often be very dirty & mossy, making it a little spooky to get to the last bolt.

# Location
Right side of Hanging Gardens wall, immediately in front of the large "table" rock that is good for staging gear on.Â  This is the right of the two easily visible bolt lines on the far right side of hanging gardens.

# Protection
4 bolts & gear to ~2". A small nut protects the crux well.

Rappel or Lower from Anchors with Rings.
