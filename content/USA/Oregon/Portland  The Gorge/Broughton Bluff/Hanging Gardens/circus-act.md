# Description
This climb is the first to grace your eyes when approaching from the main trail. The first "pitch" is the only clean line at the far right of Hanging Gardens.

The first section of climbing to the first rap rings clocks in around 5.6. A great first lead for the budding trad climber. Clip this with an alpine draw and move on.

You then have a choice to head right or left/ straight up. If you take a left, you are on Circus Act! If you head right you are on Shining Star. Once you have surmounted the crux you have the option to head left or right. I would recommend heading left for a direct finish. Enjoy.
