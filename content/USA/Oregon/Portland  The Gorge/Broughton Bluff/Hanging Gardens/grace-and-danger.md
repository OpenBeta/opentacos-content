# Description
Grace and Danger starts out on easy columns roughly ten feet to the left of Loose Block Overhang.  Scamper up the columns to the left side of the slab at which point you can place the gear which will protect you through the crux.  The gear is great (#.4 C4) but it's so far left of the climbing that a fall from the crux will result in a hard swing into the dihedral.   Place the gear, say your prayers and cast off to the right at the very bottom of the slab.  The crux is short and bouldery.  Work your way up the slab until you can grab the mini-jug that is somewhat hidden on the right side of the vegetated crack that slashes across the face.  Plug a small cam into the mini-jug wherever your fingers aren't residing (#2 C3 for me).  Above the crack, the climbing eases considerably though the finish isn't trivial.
