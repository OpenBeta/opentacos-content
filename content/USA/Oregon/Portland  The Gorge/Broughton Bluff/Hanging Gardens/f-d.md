# Description
This route makes for a thought-provoking approach to climbs on the upper portion of the wall, like Sesame Street.

Start up the fairly easy wide crack until you're standing on top of a large flake, next to a maple bush.   Step up to a short finger crack that traverses up and left, then step around the corner.  proceed up the thin crack in the corner to find larger holds where B.F.D. joins with the Hanging Gardens route.

Once you reach 2 fixed pitons, continue to the right on the H.G. route, or head up and left to the chains at the base of Sesame Street.

# Location
Right side of Hanging Gardens Wall.  Just to the left of 2 bolt-lines, and to the right of the start of the Hanging Gardens Route.  Shares start moves with Mr. Potato and From Something to Nothing.

# Protection
Pro to 2-3" with recommended emphasis on small cams/tcus.   Optional very large gear to protect the start to the top of the flake.
