# Description
"An original 1960's climb" per Tim Olson's book.  Fun, varied climb involving a little chimney, some crack holds and some face moves.

# Location
Hanging Gardens Wall - "Left Half," (but is on the far right of the "left half," so is pretty much in the middle of the wall).  To the right of the two parallel cracks (Tip City and Lean Years).  These three routes all join up at the ledge.

# Protection
TR or Pro to 4"
