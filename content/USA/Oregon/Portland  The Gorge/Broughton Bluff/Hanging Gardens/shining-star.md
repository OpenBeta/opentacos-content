# Description
P1: (5.6) Climb up a slab with broken cracks to an anchor 30' off the ground below the short overhangs.

P2: Pull over the overhang to the right, with fun hand and finger jams through the overhang (10a crux on gear) to another anchor above. Then continue up broken cracks (right of a bolted arete called Black Prow). You will reach a stance and you will see a dihedral with new SS bolts going up it. Follow the bolts to a new anchor with rap rings at the top of the cliff.

I cleaned it up when I sent it this week, and it is in good shape and well worth climbing!

# Location
As you start up the trail to the Hanging Gardens wall, look for the first clean section of rock and a anchor 30' off the ground. Start here, and the route goes over the bulge just right of the anchor.

# Protection
Gear to 2".
