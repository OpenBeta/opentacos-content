# Description
Pitch 1: Approach with any climb from Hanging Gardens 5.8 to Fun in the Mud 5.10c

Pitch 2: 5.10d PG13

From the Sesame Street ledge, go up bushy ledges, until you reach a steep, overhanging corner. Climb this corner with thin gear and ledge fall potential until you reach the awesome layback/handcrack roof. Pull over the roof and into easier climbing above. The upper portion of this route has a great position on the cliff.

New ASCA bolts w/ mussy hooks at the top.

# Location
Start at the bottom anchors for Sesame Street on a nice ledge.

# Protection
Micro cams/small nuts at the start to #2 at the top.
