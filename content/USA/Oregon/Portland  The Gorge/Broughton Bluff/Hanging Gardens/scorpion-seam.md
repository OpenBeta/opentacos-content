# Description
This route lies on top of the Hanging Gardens Wall on the black-streaked headwall at the extreme right.  It is a burly and serious climb, and some of the clips are quite difficult. A technical start leads you to a steep section that begins and ends with big throws.  The middle houses the crux.

# Location
The best way to approach this route is to climb up towards Sesame Street and from the anchors before the Sesame Street zig-zag crack traverse right on the big ledge system to the base of Scorpion Seam.

# Protection
Bolts. Recently rebolted with new SS bolts, and new anchor clips at the top.
