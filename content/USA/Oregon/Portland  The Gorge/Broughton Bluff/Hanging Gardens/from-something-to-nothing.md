# Description
A fun and easily accessible sport climb. The grade makes it inviting, but a couple challenging crux sections can catch people off guard.

The start appears mossy and the first bolt is quite high. But easy climbing up the flake & wide crack to the left make getting to the first bolt fairly straight-forward. A 4-5" cam or large hex can be used to protect the runout to the first bolt. The tough parts come at around the 4th and 6th bolts, and it's not uncommon to see bail 'biners here.

# Location
Right side of Hanging Gardens wall.   This is the left of the two easily visible  bolt lines on the far right side of hanging gardens.

# Protection
7 bolts + anchors. Optional large piece to protect getting to the first bolt. Rappel or Lower from Ring anchors
