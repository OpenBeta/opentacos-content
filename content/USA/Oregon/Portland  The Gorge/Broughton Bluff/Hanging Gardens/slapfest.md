# Description
Slapfest is an excellent and very unusual climb to be found at Broughton Bluff.  It offers a superb blend of technical arete climbing down low and burly sloper squeezing up high leading to the crux exit onto the ledge at forty feet.  The first 15 feet ascend a thin crack with gear for pro to reach the top of a pillar where the climbing really starts.  The clips on this route are difficult and you must be careful not to blow them or you'll risk decking on the pillar.  Once the ledge is reached, continue through easier terrain to the anchors atop the second pitch of Loose Block Overhang.

# Location
Starts atop the pillar just right of Loose Block Overhang.

# Protection
Small gear down low, bolts for the rest.
