# Description
Start on the same blocky steps as Giants Staircase. Stay to the right side of the steps and ascent a short off-width in a corner. Finish on easy terrain which takes you up a slot to the top of the left side of Hanging Gardens. Anchor to the closest sturdy tree and bring up your partner. A simple and obvious walk-off brings you back down to the bottom of the cliff.

This is an easily protectable and fun climb but the blocky nature and low angle dictates that the leader should not fall.

The name of the climb comes from the first ascentionists off-route wander which took her into unfamiliar terrain (a decades old tradition of blundering into FA).
