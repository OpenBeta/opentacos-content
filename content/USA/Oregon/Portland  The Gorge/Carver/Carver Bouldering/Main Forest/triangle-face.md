# Description
Beautiful triangle boulder just below Angular Motion. Start sitting on two incuts, big move right to a pinch, awkward move left to a sloper, dyno to the top. This is my favorite problem in the world. Literally. If you plopped this boulder down in the middle of Yosemite, it would still be a mega classic. Do yourself a favor and get on this problem.

# Location
From the obvious path in the back of the Inn parking lot, follow the path that goes right and uphill. Keep following the path uphill at any intersections you encounter. Just as you’re approaching the Education Boulder (uphill and on your left), you’ll see Triangle Face peeking out straight ahead and further uphill.

# Protection
Pad and spotter. If you flub the dyno, you might roll backwards into the brush.
