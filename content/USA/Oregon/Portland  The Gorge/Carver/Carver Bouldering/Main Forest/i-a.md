# Description
Sit Start on a couple good edges. Stand up and head up and left towards a juggy topout. Utilize an obviously chalked pinch and figure out a good sequence. A bit reachy.

# Location
On the "Columbia" boulder. It is the obvious large boulder that you first see upon entering the main woods. Looks like Africa.

# Protection
A pad or two
