# Description
V1 start from the level ground, maybe V0 if you start high on the sloped boulder. Reachy moves from positive jug to positive jug with big feet. Mantle top out with decent hands.

# Location
Yosemite Boulder. Obvious middle line on the NE face.

# Protection
Awkward landing on a 45 degree slope; would need 2-3 pads to cover a tumble.
