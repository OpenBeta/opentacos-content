# Description
Climbs the center of the imposing Columbia Boulder. This is perhaps my favorite climb at Carver due to its interesting sequence through a series of ledges leading to a long reach to the top. I would not recommend biffing it up there, the fall would likely be pretty nasty.

# Location
To the Right of TIA on the Columbia Boulder, climb the center of the face using a variety of face holds and ledges.

# Protection
Pads
