# Description
The rail of positive holds heading right, but mantle half way to the top.  Classic!

# Location
Around the corner from Trask (to the left if you are facing it) and across from Carver Classic.  Obvious juggy rails work up and to the right.  At this point you start standing on the downed tree.

# Protection
About 3 pads.  You'll want one/two to cover the downed tree right off the landing and one to cover the slope down to hill.
