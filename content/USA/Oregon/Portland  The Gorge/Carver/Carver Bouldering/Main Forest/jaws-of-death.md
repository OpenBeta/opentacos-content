# Description
Start matched in the sharp pod jug on the left side of the short overhang. You'll know it when you see it.

Figure your way to the right, and finish as for Cause of Death using the flake holds directly next to the arete. The big flake jug way off right on the slab is off, fyi.

# Location
Same boulder as Cause of Death, starts on the left side of the boulder.
