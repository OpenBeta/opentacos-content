# Description
Start matched on a knobbly waist high hold on the lip. Move left and up until you can reach the good flake directly next to the arete. Finish straight up.

Do not use the enticing flake jug straight above the start hold, as this decreases the difficulty substantially (and is another climb!).

# Location
From the large Columbia boulder, follow the trail to the left (looking uphill), for about 30-40 feet. The trail curves around a ramping boulder and just uphill from that is the Cause of Death Boulder.
