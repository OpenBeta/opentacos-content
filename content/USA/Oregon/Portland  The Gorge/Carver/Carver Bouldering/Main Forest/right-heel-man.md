# Description
Sit down start, with the left side pull and right crimp.  Reasonable bump with the right hand then straight to the top arete and mantle out.  Excellent warm up problem in the shadow of the imposing Yosemite Boulder!

# Location
From the parking lot, enter the main forest behind the fenced area built out for the restaurant's large garbage containers.  Follow the trail to the right and after a very short incline, you will see the large Yosemite Boulder (approx. 15-20 feet tall).  Right Heel Man is on the smaller boulder on the right hand side of Yosemite.

# Protection
2-3 crash pads AND a spotter.  If you miss the big move you could potentially fall backwards onto the point of another, smaller boulder.
