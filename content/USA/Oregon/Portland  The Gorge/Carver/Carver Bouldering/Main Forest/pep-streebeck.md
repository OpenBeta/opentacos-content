# Description
Sit start on the obvious rail and work right on the jugs near the lip.  Get to the top of the sloping right arete, stand up onto the slab and finish a few more easy moves.

Shares the same start as Virgin Connie Swail.

# Location
In the pit just to the right of Optimus Prime.

# Protection
5-6 pads to cover the pit of boulders and the sloping boulder underneath the first few moves.
