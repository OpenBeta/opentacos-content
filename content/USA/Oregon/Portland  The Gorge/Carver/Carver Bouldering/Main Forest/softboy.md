# Description
Starts with an inverted sit start in the cave of Carver classic. Jam your feet into the crack above and transition from the invert up and through the crack. Sequence climbs crack direct.

Please provide input on the grade - I've indicated V2+, but this was after refining the beta. This may change depending on community consensus. Onsight this could feel harder.

# Location
Directly to the left of Carver Classic, climbs the flaring offwidth crack formed by the two boulders.
