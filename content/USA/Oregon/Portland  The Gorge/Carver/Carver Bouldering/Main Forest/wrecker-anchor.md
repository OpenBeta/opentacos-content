# Description
Start low at the base of the arete with a nice left hand hold and low right undercling. Head straight up, using poor left hand face holds and the arete for your right.

# Location
From the top of the Carver Classic walk up and right around the side of the Squirrel Boulder. Wrecker Anchor is on the boulder with the obvious arete jutting out into space.

# Protection
Pads
