# Description
The 2011 Carver Bouldering Guide calls this "Perhaps the best problem at Carver." I'm sure that's debatable, but this is definitely a proud line.

Start standing at the low point of the boulder with a left-hand pinch and a right-hand crimp. Hike your feet up and fire for the lip. I thought this would be the crux. I was wrong.

After a powerful move using an undercling-flake thing (this might be the crux), finish with a series of long, powerful moves between evenly-spaced slopers on the lip/arete (this too might be the crux). Finish with a committing top-out at the boulder's apex (definitely the mental crux).

The upper moves are the standard finish to a number of harder problems on this boulder. I'm sure they feel casual once you've dialed them in. I chose to onsight this rig while solo bouldering and found myself definitely wishing I had a spotter.

# Location
On the Stump Boulder, just uphill from the Cedar Boulder.

# Protection
Multiple pads over a rising, terraced, uneven landing that includes a stump.  Watch out for the rocks behind the landing zone. Potential for a bad fall if you blow it in the wrong spot.
