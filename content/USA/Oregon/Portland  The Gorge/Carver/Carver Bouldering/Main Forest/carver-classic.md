# Description
Another Carver Low Ball! Start inside the obvious cave on a chalked jug and an edge on the lip of the cave. Heals will be necessary to pull of the ground. Pull up to the lip and do a heinously awkward top-out. Body-smears optional. Top out at whopping 6 feet.

# Location
In obvious low cave about 50 feet from the entrance to the main woods. Right down the hill from the "Angry Squirrel" boulder and right next to the "Columbia" boulder.

# Protection
One pad and someone to spot your head.
