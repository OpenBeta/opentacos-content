# Description
Start sitting in the overhang with a left hand sidepull and right hand edge. Figure out how to get out of the hole and up to the lip. Heck, the lip isn't even that far away, how hard could it be?

Hard.

# Location
On the parking lot side of the Columbia boulder there is the Hoik boulder leaning against it, forming a nice little cave. Hoik is visible in the short overhang as you walk by.

There is a fairly obvious low brick jug right next to the trail. This is the start to Super Cool, the low start to Hoik. Hoik starts just up and right of this brick hold.
