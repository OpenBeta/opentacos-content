# Description
Start matched on the waist high knobbly lip sloper, as for Cause of Death. Climb the beginning of Cause of Death, but transition to the left. Use the nasty slopey arete and whatever left hand holds you fancy to top out.

Climbs well, but man this is hard.

# Location
Same start as Cause of Death.
