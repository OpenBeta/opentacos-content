# Description
Start on the "education" boulder, next to the stump boulders. On the south face, there are two low crimps. Make an awkward move right to a supposedly drilled pocket and up to the rail and top out. Pretty cool movement and a long problem for Carver.

# Location
On the big boulder just below Triangle Face.

# Protection
A couple pads would be nice.
