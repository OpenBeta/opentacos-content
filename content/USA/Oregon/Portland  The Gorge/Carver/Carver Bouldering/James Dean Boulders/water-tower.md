# Description
A bit of a different style than most Carver problems. Technical crux is probably getting on the thing. Mental crux is committing to the friction slab moves at the dirty pine needle covered top. Bringing a brush recommended. Stay right for the V0, follow the crack left for the V4 traverse problem

# Location
Obvious funnel slab on the North face of Water Tower Boulder.

# Protection
Maybe 2 or 3 pads if you're by yourself.
