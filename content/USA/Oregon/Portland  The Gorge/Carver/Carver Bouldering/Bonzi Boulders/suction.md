# Description
Sit start on the two obviously drilled monos. Make a couple moves up and left to an easy top out. These monos are so circular and uniform that your fingers will make a suction sound as they pop out. You may have to use your ring fingers if you have sausages. The grade on this problem is relative as it is so strange and finger size dependent. I have heard it called up to V5. A stand start from a couple moves into the problem goes at V1ish and is probably the better option. Let's just call that option Sugar.

# Location
On the "Sugar Cube" boulder in the Bonzais. It is the cubic boulder that you will run into if you walk straight along the main trail.

# Protection
Pad and a spot to keep you off the tree
