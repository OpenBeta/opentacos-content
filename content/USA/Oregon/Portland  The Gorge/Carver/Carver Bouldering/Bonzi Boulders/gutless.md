# Description
SDS. Start matched on the V hold (Right hand start hold of Gut Crunch). Move up and right into the shallow scoop. There are a plethora of edges to choose from, although they are all fairly poor. Top out straight up with the use of a nice blocky pinch.

The jugs on the arete to the left are off.

Trickery is quite useful.

# Location
Same boulder as Gut Crunch.

# Protection
Pads
