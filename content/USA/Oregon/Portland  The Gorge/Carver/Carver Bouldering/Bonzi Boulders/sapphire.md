# Description
SDS with right hand in the pod, left hand on the lower arete. The old guidebook pegged this at V1, but the starting feet are so polished and crumbled off it might be closer to V2 now. The hands are so good, but the feet so delicate; makes great precision footwork practice.

There was supposed to be another V1 "Rough Diamond" slightly to the right, but I couldn't find anything that felt like it.

# Location
Diamond boulder, the southern most boulder in the Bonzi area. Follow the overgrown uphill trail between Ledge and Greed boulders to find the only clean boulder sitting by itself back in the woods a bit.

# Protection
1-2 pads.
