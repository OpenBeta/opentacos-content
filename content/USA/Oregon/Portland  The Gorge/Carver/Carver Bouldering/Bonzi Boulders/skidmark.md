# Description
A fun,technical face. Start low on a good right open-hand and a left handed edge. Toss to a hold on the arete and make your way to the top. Fairly reachy. Short people will have to figure out something tricky to make it to the arete. Really a great problem and worth the exploration it will probably take to find.

# Location
Far in the back of the Bonzais. Follow the trail past the main group of boulders and towards the road. The trail to this one is mostly overgrown. The problem itself was completely overgrown when I found it and required total cleaning.
