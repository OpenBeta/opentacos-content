# Description
Start sitting with a nice left hang crimp and a sloping edge up and right. Pull on and bump up and right to the next (larger) sloping edge. Continue to the sloping lip up and left.

There is a jug on the lip to the right, if you finish here you just did Red Meat Ma'am (V7). For full credit, you have to use the sloping parts of the lip only. It's an eliminate, but hey, still fun.

# Location
From Gut Crunch walk downhill 20 feet to the boulder with a nice arete hold directly next to a tree. This is the Red Meat boulder. Red Meat Man starts about 5 feet around from the aforementioned arete.
