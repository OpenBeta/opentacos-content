# Description
Grab the good right hand edge and the bad left sloper or tiny edge. Figure out where to put your feet and slap your way up and over the nose. About as good as it gets in the Bonzais! With the right beta, this route is pretty cruiser. Without, it will feel desperate.

# Location
The prominent nose of rock on the "Gut Crunch" boulder. This boulder is on the left side of the trail when walking into the Bonzais. It is always chalked and extremely obvious.
