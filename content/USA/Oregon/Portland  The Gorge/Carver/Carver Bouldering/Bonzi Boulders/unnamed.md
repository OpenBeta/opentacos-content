# Description
Sit start, with low right and left hands opposing the aretes at face level (while sitting). Bust a powerful first move and continue directly up the pillar. The crux is pulling of the ground/making the first move. Taller folk might have trouble with the beta as it is a VERY bunchy climb. It is a pure compression line with no shortcuts, cheats, or gimmicks; power and psych are all you need.

# Location
This bloc is left of the Greed boulder, where Daddy Fat Sax V4 is located. This is on the outskirts of the Bonzai Boulders if you continue walking away from the parking lot and towards the road. It is the very obvious and very small pillar.

GPS Location: N 45.391854, W 122.4972653

# Protection
A single pad should be more than enough to negotiate this one; although, a spotter might be nice as the landing partially drops off, to the left.
