# Description
Start on the obvious chalked edge. Choose between any of the wrong-facing foot chips and make a surprisingly desperate and awkward move to a good hold on the lip. Cruise to the top with good feet and hands. Starting on the lip hold goes around V1.

# Location
In the Bonzais. Always chalked and straight across from Neanderthal.

# Protection
Pads
