# Description
SDS with huge undercling for your right hand and great feet and move up through a series of very small crimps finishing on a easy jug and moving up and left to the apex of the boulder.

# Location
Located on the the Ledge Boulder. If your walking down from the upper parking lot stay to your right as if your going straight down to the main road and it'll be on your right about midway down the trail. This one is often found cleaned and chalked unlike a lot of Carver so it should be easy to find.

# Protection
one pad is plenty. the crux is basically moving your right foot into the jug after you get your two hands up on the micro crimps so your basically one foot off the ground at that point and therefore you really don't need a spotter.
