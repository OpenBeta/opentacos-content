# Description
Sit start in the pit on the undercling. Move up the prow to the sharp tooth hold. Match it and go for the jawbone rail. Two finishes left and right of the jawbone, both at the same grade.

A lot easier if you skip the match and shoot right to a flake. Would be a 4 star route if you couldn't.

# Location
Farthest end of the pit in the Carpet Boulder area

# Protection
2 pads
