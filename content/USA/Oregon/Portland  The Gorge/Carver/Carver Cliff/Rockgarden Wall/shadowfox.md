# Description
Let's reclaim this forgotten gem- Start in the wide right side of the Combination Block and traverse right to the thin crack. Still dirty, but will get clean with traffic. The original anchor was off to the right as the crack peters out, but a more logical finish follows the crack left towards Wally Street. Keep an eye out for helpful pockets and edges on the right as you climb.

# Location
This route starts immediately right of the Combination Block. Follow the obvious crack splitting the face to an anchor.

# Protection
This crack eats up nuts and small cams (no larger than .5").
