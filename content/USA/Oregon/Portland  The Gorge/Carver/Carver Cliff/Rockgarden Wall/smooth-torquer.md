# Description
With more ascents this route will definitely get less mossy, but probably not less slick.  The crux comes just after the second bolt and lasts for about five moves.  A couple of moves go straight above the bolt, but then veer to your right.  The upper slab is fun, but mossy.  Get ready to crimp and hang on tight...Smooth Torquer is what the name implies and more stout than Rip Grip.

# Location
The first route left of Smerk.
