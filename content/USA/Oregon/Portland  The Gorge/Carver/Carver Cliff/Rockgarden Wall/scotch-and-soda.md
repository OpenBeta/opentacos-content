# Description
Start in the finger crack around the corner from New Generation. Climb up until you can step onto a pedestal and climb the bolted arete to the top.

# Location
Located right next to New Generation, can't miss it.

# Protection
QD's for higher up and some cams. I took two .5's, a .4, and a yellow TCU. You can place a good nut at the start too if you want.
