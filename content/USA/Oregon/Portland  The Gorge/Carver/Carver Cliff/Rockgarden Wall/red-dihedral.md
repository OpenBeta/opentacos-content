# Description
Interesting climb that starts up a cruxy crack and continues into a dihedral. Pro gets a little small near the scary and old rusty piton at the top of the dihedral. The climb was so lichen covered and slippery, I opted to traverse right to the anchor visible from the ground, rather than continue up the dirty and moss covered dihedral to its end (as suggested in the Portland Rock Climbs book. I felt this climb was a bit sandbagged at 5.10a (the grade given in the guidebook).
