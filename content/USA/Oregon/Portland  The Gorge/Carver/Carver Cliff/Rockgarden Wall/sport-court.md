# Description
This route is a link up of Sea of Holes and Wally Street, but is a worth-while route that links the better parts of the two routes together and avoids the very dirty upper part of Sea of Holes.

Start up Sanity Assassin to reach the top of the pillar and the beginning of Sea of Holes. Then follow Sea of Holes past the first three bolts (and an old piton) and move right into Wally Street once on the slabby section of Sea of Holes.  A large foot ledge awaits and gives you the rest needed before entering the overhanging portion of Wally Street.

# Location
On the right half of Rock Garden Wall and right of Night Vision and the climbers sign.

# Protection
Bolts.
