# Description
Some enhanced/drilled holds at the start mar an otherwise outstanding pitch. No single move is that difficult- the crux is being able to hold on until you reach the jug at the last bolt. This route contains some great movement and should be a part of the "Carver Circuit".

# Location
The best and most logical start for this route is Shadowfox (located just right of the Combination Block). From the anchor, continue up the prominent red streak. Can link Shadowfox and Wally Street in one pitch with a 60m rope.

# Protection
Five protection bolts to a bolted anchor at a ledge.
