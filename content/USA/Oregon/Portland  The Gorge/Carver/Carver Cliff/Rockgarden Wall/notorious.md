# Description
Start on the steep hillside. Make a few technical arete moves that lead to a huge jug. Either use an intermediate or make a huge dyno to a massive hold. Get a good shake and then pull the crux, reaching out left to the sloper around the left corner. A few difficult moves lead to moderate climbing with big holds. The climb goes over a ledge at the top to anchors.

# Location
Left side of Rockgarden Wall. Start on the steep hillside.
