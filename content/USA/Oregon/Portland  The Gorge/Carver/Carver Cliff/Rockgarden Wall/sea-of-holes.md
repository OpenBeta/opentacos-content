# Description
This route begins on top of the combination block. The business begins after the first pin and continues till the 5th. Hard pocket pulling and balance is the key to sending this Carver classic. The route finishes on easy slab moves to a two bolt anchor. However, this route is in desperate need of moss removal and cleaning, it will be a classic if a good sam steps up.

# Location
To the right of the "rock climbing is dangerous sign"

# Protection
6 bolts and a pin (plus 2 for the Sanity Assassin approach)
