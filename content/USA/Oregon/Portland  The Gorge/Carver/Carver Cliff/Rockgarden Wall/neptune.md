# Description
This is the obvious off-width/chimney climb to the left of Smooth Torquer.  Place your gear in the smaller crack that is on the right and wiggle up the route with your back against the felt wall.  It is fairly dirty, but solid rock and fun moves make it worth your time (and with more ascents it is sure to get better).  A hollow sounding flake is near the top, but seems to be solid enough...just tred lightly.

# Location
Left side of Rock Garden Wall and left of Smooth Torquer.

# Protection
Gear to 2" and bolted anchor.
