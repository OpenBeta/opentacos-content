# Description
A strong crux off the ground leads to more balancy climbing with good holds above. Fun small edges and pockets keep the climbing entertaining through most of the first pitch. . Five bolts to the first anchor (11a).

The second pitch of this is also reasonably clean and pretty good. Four more bolts to another anchor (10c). A 60m rope will get you down from the 2nd pitch anchor.

The third pitch is mossy but easier. A 60m rope probably isn't long enough unless doing

New Generation

as first pitch.
