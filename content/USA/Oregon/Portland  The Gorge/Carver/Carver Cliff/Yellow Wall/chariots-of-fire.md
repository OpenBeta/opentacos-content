# Description
The awesome-looking, lichen-covered, overhanging crack above the slab. Although the difficult climbing doesn't last long, the exposure is wild as you commit to the tipped back traverse to the anchor.

# Location
Mosey up the left side of the slab placing gear if you find it or solo up to the first anchor (5.4). After the first anchor the crack looms above and the business begins!

# Protection
Pro to 3" (there's one wide spot). Bolted anchor (Metolius Rap hangers).
