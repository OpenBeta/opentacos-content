# Description
Despite this route's short stature, it as the name implies challenging.  Begin on easy slab climbing to the first bolt where big moves on small incut holds await. Move past two more bolts up and left or head right after the third into an enjoyable undercling.

# Location
Furthest bolted line to the right

# Protection
Three bolts and bolt anchor.
