# Description
A decent little climb.  Solo half-way up the left side of the Chemistry Slab and look for a black painted hanger on the left wall. Clip this and start the traverse.  There's a fixed pin shortly after the first bolt, clip it with a quickdraw if you enjoy rope-drag.  Make a couple of moves out left to join the last bolt and climbing of Angular Motion. Out On A Limb is a bit spicy as a fall in the middle of the traverse (crux) would put you on or very near the slab behind you.  Despite this, it's a fun, worthwhile climb and the necky section only lasts for a move or two.  If you don't come down with at least a little bit of yellow lichen on your clothes, you are not doing this climb right.

There is a totally ignored second pitch that's mossed over. Skip it or risk your hide like I did a few years back.

Two, black painted bolts and an unhelpful fixed piton.  Optional gear for the Chemistry Slab.
