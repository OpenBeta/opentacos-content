# Description
After 30 ft. of scrambling through an overgrown slab, this route finally gets to business at a very thin and powerful crux.  It's a bit dirty and it's drilled/chipped, but this is about as tough as it gets at Carver.

# Location
Start on the right side of the gully, left of the Angular Motion wall.

# Protection
