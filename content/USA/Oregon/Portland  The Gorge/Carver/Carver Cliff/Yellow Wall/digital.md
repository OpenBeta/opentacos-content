# Description
A series of very thin crimps up a gentle overhang is the prelude to a tricky dyno, which is followed by a mantle and a couple of slab moves.  Very bouldery.

The first bolt comes after some pretty strenuous moves so it would probably be wise to pre-clip it.  An alternative to climbing straight up to the first bolt is to start up Angular Motion and traverse over after 10ft. or so.

# Location
Just to the left of the classic Angular Motion, which is immediately to the left of the large slab.

# Protection
Quickdraws
