# Description
Start on the far left margin of the Yellow Wall and move up a low angled ramp trending right. After clipping the first bolt step across the gap onto the slab. Alternatively, climb the crack, skipping the first bolt, for a more direct start. Traverse across the slab into a few technical, vertical moves and pull up to a ledge. Move left along a horizontal crack system with big holds. Make some technical moves into the dihedral. Pull out the top of the dihedral and traverse right along a slab. Some big holds lead to a massive lie-back flake. Make some juggy moves and you are at the anchor.

# Location
Far left side of Yellow Wall, first bolted line (right trending, above
