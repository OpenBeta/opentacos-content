# Description
This route is a hand crack following the right edge of the chemistry slab. It appears that you have to layback your way up, but that's not the case with ample feet up the slab for balance. Plenty of good stances abound.

Have the second clean this route as doing so when lowering will pull you away from the crack.

# Location
Right side of Chemistry Slab.

# Protection
Pro to 1.5" with anchors shared with Crimson Tide. Has steel sport biners for lowering (do not use for TR). There is one bolt just below the anchors.
