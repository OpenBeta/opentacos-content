# Description
One of the best routes at Carver.  It has two solid cruxes and the movement is fantastic.  The bottom crux is a powerful move off of a pinch, and the top is a more delicate sequence up the arete.  Just be sure not to blow the second clip.

Highly recommended

# Location
The first route to the left of the large slab.

# Protection
5 bolts
