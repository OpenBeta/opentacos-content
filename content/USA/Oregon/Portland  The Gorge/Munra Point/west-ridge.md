# Description
The crux is a short 3rd - 4th class ramp enroute to the summit.

This route can be very slippery on a rainy day or shortly after a rain. Retrace your steps for the descent.

# Location
Hike west along the Gorge trail for 1.5 miles to the intersection with the west ridge route. Climb steeply from here to the summit.

# Protection
Most people solo this route, some may want a rope for the short 4th class section.
