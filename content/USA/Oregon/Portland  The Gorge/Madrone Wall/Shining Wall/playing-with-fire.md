# Description
This route is currently filthy. Gear is tricky to place (offset nuts helpful), the low crux is out-of-character with the upper section, and the rock quality up high leaves much to be desired. It also seeps.

Start as for

The Shining

but continue up to the shared low ledge of

Paleontologist

and step straight into the thin dihedral. Use odd, less-than-great holds to get into a stemming stance for clipping the bolt. Pull off the sloping holds on the ledge and reeeeach for a decent edge up high. Cut your feet for show? Don't blow it as you move way up past your bolt to a dirty ledge and step left to the crack. Feather in some gear here (a 1.5" cam works wonders) then mount the mini-bulge. The crack seams out, so work your feet high and make a reach for the next locking finger jam. Make another hard move to establish your feet on the left. Pull through this relatively easy bit to an awkward move onto the next ledge. A final series of fun moves up the tight dihedral on questionable edges and sidepulls leads to the final rightward pull onto the anchor ledge shared with

The Shining

.
