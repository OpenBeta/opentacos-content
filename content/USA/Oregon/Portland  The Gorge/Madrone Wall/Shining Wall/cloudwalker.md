# Description
This route will probably be done more often as a 10b rather than the original 11c.

New Start:

Begin as for

The Shining

, climbing the face for two bolts - extend the second clip. At the blocky section before the ledge, cut hard right to another bolt before getting to the crack.

Original Start:

Climb a thin seam next to a clump of madrone trees. A stick-clip is recommended. Stem off the tree as high as you can then grab a hold way off to the left to get situated. Far-off jugs, crack technique, and a sweet undercling get you to a stance with another bolt. One final thin sequence takes you up to where the two options join.

Climb up the thin crack with features to either side. Small nuts are essential through this section. Step right and then follow the thin layback crack up to the bulge. Stem out and use cool holds at the lip to pull up over it and onto the slab above. From this stance, follow the hand crack up to where you can cut right to the anchor shared with

Banana Belt

.

# Location
