# Description
This line was rated 5.11c(R) in the Olson guide, maybe because of the terrifying 1/4 bolts that snapped as soon as we tried to remove them? It now sports new SS bolts and a 40' extension to the top of the cliff, and certainly isn't R rated, and its also not 5.11c, more like 5.11a at most.

Climb up the slot to the first, bolt, placing a cam there if desired. Then follow fun and slightly sloping edges to a thin, one move crux. Follow the good edges up to an overhang, and pull though on good jugs to the sweet finger crack and stem and jam your way to the anchor. Really fun route, inspite of a little dirt in the upper half.

# Location
Middle of Shining Wall. Its the first route after you step up off the trail below the cliff.

# Protection
Gear from BD 0.4-2 and draws.
