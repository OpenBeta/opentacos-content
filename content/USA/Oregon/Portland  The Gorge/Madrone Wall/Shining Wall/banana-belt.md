# Description
Start up a thin crack right next to a madrone tree (it's on). This ends at a chunky section (gear here). Get hand jams behind the flake then make an awkward pull onto the ledge. This is shared with

Beginner's Luck

- you could approach the route from this start. Step left and up into the dihedral, following a flake and edges up to the first bolt. Step right around the roof, finding gear in the corner. Step back left along small crimps, make tenuous moves to jugs above, then pull a heady mantel onto a ledge. Climb the brief corner and step left onto the small stance at the anchor. This is shared with

Cloudwalker

to the left.

# Location
Just right of the Shining Wall's main area, next to a clump of madrone trees growing close to the wall
