# Description
Start with some stemming, jamming and/or easy lie-backing up the crack until it ends and the climb trends right along good flakes, blocks and edges to a large ledge with shared anchor midway through Lion's Jaw.  Some of the blocks in the middle are a bit chossy and some small loose rocks on the ledge, but there is good gear to be found throughout.

# Location
Left side of Shining Wall.  Starts in a wide crack in a shallow corner about halfway between "Firing Line," and "Dancing in the Lion's Jaw."

# Protection
Gear to 3", anchor with rap rings
