# Description
This route is quite the spicy adventure for now.

Step off the boulder, plugging small gear, and pull up to a stance. You'll have to make another hard awkward move with the possibility of a ground-fall before you can get to a better stance and decent gear. Climb through horizontal breaks and around some vegetation. Feather in some funky gear and step right at a bulge with a bush. Once on the edgy slab, follow the bolts up to a brief dihedral. Mantel awkwardly onto a dirt-covered ledge with tragic fall potential.

Once on the ledge, finesse your way over the dirt mound and stem past the seam until it opens up for gear. Don't get sucked into the slot; keep your eyes out left for the jagged crack. Step left at the jumbly mess or punch it straight through the hand/finger crack (not 5.7). Scramble up the slab to the anchor in the corner.

# Location
Left side of the Shining Wall main area, above an alder bush growing beneath a big undercut in the wall base of the wall

# Protection
Gear to 2", 2 bolts, anchor with rap rings
