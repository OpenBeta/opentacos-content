# Description
Highly-quality moderate crack climb. Harder than originally graded. Tenuous but fun start to a series of unprotected ledges. Move up and left via wide cracks, then step up into roof hand crack. Make a few hard pulls up into a stemming stance. Traverse right along the rail and pull onto the anchor ledge.

You can optionally continue another 15' straight up on

is not a good top-rope because of swing potential after unclipping the last bolt.
