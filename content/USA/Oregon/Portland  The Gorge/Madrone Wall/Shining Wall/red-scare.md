# Description
This is the access pitch for

Arm Forces

(11+/12-) and

Cold Hand of Technology

(10+).

A stick-clip is highly recommended for anyone who might be challenged at this grade. Make hard, tenuous moves either off the boulder or straight up the minor slot. Find the hidden jug in the crack and then make long reaches on small feet past several breaks. Around the third bolt, make sure to stay right and avoid the loose chunks on the left. Keeping pulling until you reach the anchor on the ledge.

Arm Forces

goes up to the left and

Cold Hand of Technology

goes up to the right; easily linked with either.
