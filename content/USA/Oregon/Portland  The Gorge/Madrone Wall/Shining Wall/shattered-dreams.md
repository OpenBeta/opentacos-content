# Description
The start is a bit precarious, so consider anchoring your belayer with a long sling around the tree. Start up a thin crack with nearby face features; your first piece comes at about 10'. From here it opens to thin hands, though grabby holds are available. This feature ends at a small, bushy ledge. From here, go straight up the arete, clipping bolts as you go. Step left across a thin face at the last bolt and into the short final crack that ends at the anchor stance.

# Location
On a raised platform near a huge madrone tree whose root forms the means of access. Just right of

Plywood Jungle

.

# Protection
Gear to 3", 3 bolts, anchor with rap rings
