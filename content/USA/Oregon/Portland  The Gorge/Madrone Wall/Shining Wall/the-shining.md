# Description
Long, proud line rising out from the trees.  Some light juggish pulling leads to a thin flake before the business.  Crimps, small holds, and high feet lead to a (currently) dirty-ish dihedral/arete thing that needs you to believe it will work.  It does.

# Location
Locate Paleontologist, head climber's right past the lone bolt on the open book, to some dark rock with bolts rising up to the orange wall above.  Step off the boulder and go.

# Protection
Quickdraws, 9, I think...
