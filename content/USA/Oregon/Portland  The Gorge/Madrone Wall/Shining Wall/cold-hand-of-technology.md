# Description
From the anchors of

Red Scare

step up right to a stance above the ledge and then launch into the dihedral. Stemming and finger-pockets in the crack allow progress up to a ledge on the right. Don't get sucked

too

far out, as you have to make a tenuous step back left onto the face as the crack cuts diagonally towards the anchors. Make airy pulls along this feature until you can reach a hard-to-see hold around the corner. Make a final sporty move to the anchor.

# Location
Left side of Shining Wall, above

Red Scare

and right of

Arm Forces

# Protection
Gear to 1.25", very small cams helpful, anchor with rap rings
