# Description
An excellent moderate trad climb! Make your way past/around the moss to the crack below the overhangs. Step left around these features to the crux left foot smear to a blind reach over the lip and thank-god-jugs. Move right then back left, heading for the obvious anchors. Step around a corner and then stem out to get a secure stance to clip the anchors.

# Location
Below "The Flakes" which are just left of the

Nouveau Riche

diagonal crack start

# Protection
Gear to 3", though a 4" cam could be useful right below the anchor
