# Description
The route starts with finger-locks and face holds through a slight overhang. Pull through this quickly to avoid a pump. Next is a thin layback crack, which may be the crux for some. Once atop this, step right to a hand crack through a bulge (easier than it looks), some scrambling up to a stance below a bunch of large chockstones that

appear

to be solid. Step left around these using long runners and you've arrived at the anchors.

# Location
Left of

Goldfingers

, right of The Flakes. An obvious leftward diagonal crack through an overhang right off the ground.

# Protection
Gear to 2", offset anchors with mussy hooks
