# Description
Make easy moves to the first bolt, followed by a short, technical crux getting to the second bolt. A couple of easier, but not give-me moves will bring you to the true crux: finding your way up onto the dirty slab just past the third bolt. Once onto the slab, clip another bolt before arriving Â at a shared anchor with three other routes.

# Location
Obvious bolt-line to the right after the trail climbs up from the Shining area. If coming from the east trail, look to the right after you turn the corner past Windows of Your Mind.

# Protection
Four bolts
