# Description
Locate the triangular inset features along an obvious crack. It starts off overhanging, so plug gear early and pull through a stance in the "window". Step out right and make another, more strenuous move that can be eased with creative body positioning. Once in the dihedral, it is best to go straight up and then make a final step out right. Otherwise, step out left to another ledge above

Red Fox
