# Description
Start in a vertical fist sized crack with face holds just left of Red Sun Rising.  Follow the crack up to a stance left of the small roof.  An easier line goes further left to a single bolt (clip with extended sling) before the short crux sequence going back right over a small bulge, up to a ledge, then continuing right to the anchors above the roof.  Generally good quality rock, stances for gear placement, and fun climbing makes this a good option for a newer leader. (5.8)

Alternatively to heading to the single bolt, once above the crack stay closer to the roof following smaller cracks and jugs (crux) to end at the same anchor.  (5.9)

Anchor shared with Red Sun Rising and It Takes a Thief.  Both of these routes can be top roped with a redirect.

# Location
About midway between the Shining wall and the right hand access trail.  Large flat area to belay from.  Look for a small roof with a single bolt about six feet to left side.  This is the single bolt for the route.

# Protection
Nuts and cams to 2".
