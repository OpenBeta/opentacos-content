# Description
This aesthetic thin corner crack climbs decently well and features a couple of museum/trashcan quality fixed pieces.

Start just left of Crystal Hunter and work your way up and left through blocky jugs and decent, if not obvious pro, to a good stance at the base of the dihedral. Finesse your way up, passing a nauseatingly old and rusted fixed nut and pin (it holds!) to a powerful crux exiting the dihedral. Continue up and left to the anchor shared with

Miss Adventure

or right to the anchor for

Crystal Hunter

and

Winds of War

.

# Location
Dihedral just left of the obvious face crack Crystal Hunter.

# Protection
Gear to 1.5" + a couple fixed pieces. Save a sling for the traverse to the anchors.
