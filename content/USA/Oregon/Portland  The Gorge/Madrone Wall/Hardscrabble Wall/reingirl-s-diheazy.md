# Description
This is a combination of

Reinhold's Dihedral

and

Girl Crazy

. These were done at different times by different people. The old anchor at 30' has been removed and now there is one distinct quality line.

Start up the diagonal corner, stemming out and feathering in gear where you can. Balance and power through thin moves and mantel onto the ledge. Step up a few blocks, get a 2" cam in the slot, then slither onto the next ledge. Continue straight up the line of bolts, making use of incredibly ergonomic holds on the face and around the corner. Keep pulling until you find yourself in an awkward off-width finish.
