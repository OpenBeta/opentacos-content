# Description
The route could start just left of

Life As We Know It

, but that option is currently choked with poison oak. Instead, start as for

Chicken

, heading up and right, avoiding poison oak at 20'. Pull through a brief tricky sequence onto a ledge. The route used to end here, but I added a 20' extension to a new anchor (8/19).

Step towards the back of the ledge and stem up into a stance with good holds and a crack, but suddenly no feet. Note the old raven nest immediately to your right. Make a technical but not-too-difficult move to snag the horn up and left, pull up to a small ledge, and you're at the anchors.

Note:

Don't pull too hard on the blocks up and left of the anchor - you don't even need to touch them, really. I yarded on them and they didn't budge but time may loosen them.

# Location
Far left side of Hardscrabble, left of the

Red Sun Rising

open belay area, just left of a healthy poison oak bush on the wall 20' up.

# Protection
Gear to 1.5", rap hangers at anchor
