# Description
Vertical crack with good edges and a stance through the first 25ft.  Place gear where you can before reaching the crux move, clearing the edge to a stance onto the slab and into a finger crack.  Expect that the crack could be dirty and the slab mossy.  Once over the crux move up through several easier moves and then traverse slightly right to the bolted anchors shared with the three other routes on the wall.

# Location
Just left of the bolt-line for 'Winds of War.'  Broken crack splitting the face. Shared anchor.

# Protection
Gear to 1". Off-set nuts and TCUs recommended.
