# Description
A sweet little arête climb that culminates in a desperate lunge. Very bouldery and fun. After the arête, Divine Wind joins with Exodus. Bring a few small cams to protect this final section of easy climbing.

# Location
This is the first route you'll see when you walk up the north access trail.

# Protection
bolts + gear to 1"
