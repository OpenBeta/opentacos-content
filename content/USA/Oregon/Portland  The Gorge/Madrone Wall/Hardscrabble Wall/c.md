# Description
Getting off the ground is the first crux, followed by the strenuous beached whale maneuver required to pull over the slope-y lip. Once you get the sequence the bottom gets easier but haven't yet found a more graceful pull over. Mellows out after you pass the hump. Definitely going back for more.

# Location
Between "Windows of Your Mind" and "Screensaver"/"Electric Everything". Slightly overhanging slab section on the bottom. Stand on a small boulder on the ground. Madrone tree immediately right.

# Protection
Lead up "Windows" and TR PC
