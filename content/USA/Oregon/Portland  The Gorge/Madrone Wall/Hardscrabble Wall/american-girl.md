# Description
Head up easy broken steps to a corner crack and follow it up to a small roof and top out left to a blocky slab and bolted anchors.

# Location
This route is in the middle of the left section of the hardscrabble wall. There’s a cluster of 3 trees right at the base. Just to the left of miss adventure and primordial soup.

# Protection
Single rack with pro to 1 inch. There’s a few tricky horizontal placements and also a thin crack that doesn’t take much gear. There’s a really rusty piton (marked as an “X” in the guide) at the top just before you top out, there’s good gear in a crack to the right of it to back it up. There’s spots for gear after you top out and the anchors are nice new SS bolts and rings.
