# Description

Easy climbing over dirty, blocky ledges to the right of Winds of War. Â Clip the last bolt of WoW before moving up to the shared anchor. \
Fairly unremarkable, but good practice for a new leader, or to set up TR for other climbs on the wall. \
_Beware the bush growing out of the rock at the first ledge is poison oak_

# Location

Start about 10' to the right of the boltline for Winds of War.

# Protection

Small rack to #3, 1 bolt.
