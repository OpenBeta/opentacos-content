# Description
Start in an alcove right of a dead madrone tree or just right of this at an easier seam through a slab. Move between diagonal breaks in the shattered arete and then step right onto the slab. The vertical crack has good placements for smaller cams but the gear gets tricky due to questionable rock around the crux. The holds are solid though. Make a strenuous series of moves up to the flake and step left. The route eases significantly from here but remains engaging. Follow the hand crack up past a series of small ledges, over a horn of rock, and up through more slabby hand crack fun. End at the big ledge below the fir tree.

# Location
The route up a fairly prominent prow, right and downhill from the bolted

Winds of War

line. Just right of an obvious poison oak bush about 20' up.

# Protection
Gear to 2", anchor with rap rings
