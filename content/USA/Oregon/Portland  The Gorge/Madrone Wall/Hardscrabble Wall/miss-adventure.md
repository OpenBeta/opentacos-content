# Description
Climb into the chunky blocks up towards the splitter finger crack. Plug gear then pull up to a stance. Continue up this crack to another ledge and trend left underneath the roof. Step back out right using the technique of your choice (jamming, laybacking, crimping are all options) and mount the anchor ledge.

# Location
Left side of Hardscrabble, three cracks left of the Winds of War bolt line. Punches through an intimidating roof at the top.

# Protection
Gear to 2". Rap anchors.
