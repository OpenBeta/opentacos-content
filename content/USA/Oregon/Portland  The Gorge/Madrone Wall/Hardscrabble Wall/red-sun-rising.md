# Description
Boulder up an unprotected and balance-y seam about 15-20 feet to easy ledges below the roof with a lone bolt. Place a couple finger sized cams from the ledge, then make steep moves to reach the bolt and pull through the roof. If you don't want to deck, place a bomber nut in the crack about a body length past the bolt, and that same crack also takes a 1-2 inch cam once you stand above the roof. Easy terrain leads up and left on ledges to the anchor.

# Location
Fairly easy to find: look for a lone bolt to the left of a prominent roof, about 25 feet up. About 15 feet to the right is a 10d route with 2 bolts on it. These routes have different starts but the same finish and anchor.

# Protection
Trad gear to 2 inches, one bolt (see description).
