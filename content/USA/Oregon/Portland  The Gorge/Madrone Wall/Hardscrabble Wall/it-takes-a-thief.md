# Description
This route takes more technical climbing skills than the average 5.10 does. Work up to the holds below the giant undercling flake, and then figure out the slick crux, and pull up and around the roof and then head up and left to the anchor shared with Red Sun Rising. This can be done with just bolts, as the last 20' is pretty easy, but if you aren't up to it, bring gear to 1".

# Location
Just right of Red Sun Rising, right where the trail dips away from the wall.

# Protection
Bolts, gear to 1".
