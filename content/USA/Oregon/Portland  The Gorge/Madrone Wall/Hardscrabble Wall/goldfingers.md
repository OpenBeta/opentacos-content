# Description
Climb the colorful, ledgy corner with very small gear (micro- or ball-nuts) to a slithery mantle. Use finger pods in the thin crack but step right to the wider crack. Utilize both and some creative body position to move through the crux to a stance. For the grovel finish, step left along the horizontal, then shove a knee into the wide crack and then beach whale onto the anchor ledge. Otherwise climb a series of hand cracks to the right side of the ledge then walk across it to the anchors shared with
