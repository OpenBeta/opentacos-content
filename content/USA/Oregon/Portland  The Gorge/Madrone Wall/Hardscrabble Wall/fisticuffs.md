# Description
A fun top-rope boulder problem. Leap, jam and claw your way up Fisticuffs until it ends at the mossy ledges. A good one to do after climbing Goldfingers or Reihnhold’s Diheazy.

# Location
In between Reinhold’s Dihedral and Golfingers.  The smooth, overhung face that’s split by a seam.  Look for the triangle pocket.

# Protection
Top-rope from the Goldfingers anchor.
