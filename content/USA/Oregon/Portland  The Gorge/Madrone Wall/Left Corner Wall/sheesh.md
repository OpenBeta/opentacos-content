# Description
Start up a couple easy steps to the

very

narrow crack. Place tiny nuts here and go for it, making odd scumming moves up the corner until you can reach the bomber horizontal. Get some gear here and pull hard into the crack behind the detached pillar (nuts are better than cams here). Once on top, follow the last few moves of

Patrick's Dihedral

to the shared anchor.

# Location
Middle of Left Corner Wall, left of the low bolted overhang of

Identity Crisis

# Protection
Gear to 1", small nuts at the crux, anchor with rap rings
