# Description
Make your way awkwardly up to the first set of rails and clip the first bolt below the overhang-block. Get up to this and duck left. Clip the second bolt from a secure stance. Make a deceptively hard move onto the slab above. Features abound, but the route gets spicy from here. Work your way up to the third bolt, then gun it through the easiest section with a fairly long but safe runout. Get gear in before the upper bulge, where the route joins

Into the Black

for the final thought-provoking move. A couple steps and you're at the anchor.

# Location
Middle of the Left Corner Wall, starts beneath the low square-cut overhang

# Protection
3 bolts, gear to 1.25", anchor with rap rings
