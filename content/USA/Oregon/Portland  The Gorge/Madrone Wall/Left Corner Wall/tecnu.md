# Description
Step up on top of a boulder behind the bush and then trend back left on perfectly ergonomic holds to a stance. Scope out the sharp outer edge of the crack, place gear deep inside of it, and use the undulations to make upward progress to the first bulge. Fiddle in some gear then pull the bulge, which requires a little trickery. Once on the sloping ledge, plug a 3" cam then wiggle up through the slot in the next bulge, snagging jugs that require a bit of a reach up and to the left. Victory romp to the anchors.

# Location
Far left side of the wall, right-trending diagonal crack through two bulges.

# Protection
Gear to 3", anchor with rap rings
