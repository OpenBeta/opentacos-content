# Description
Start up the thin crack, finding feet where they exist, and getting your tips in the crack. Look for holds out right to ease the awkwardness. Once you're at the piton things ease up a bit, and the crack widens for some good hand-jams and flake-jugs. Step left around the slight bulge on big edges and pull up to the midway ledge. Make another awkward move off of this ledge and move left onto the slab. Set yourself up below the final bulge and find your sequence. Once on this ledge, a final easy move delivers you to the anchors shared with

Identity

and

Mental Crisis

, both worthy top-ropes if you're keen.

# Location
An obvious left-trending corner between the bolt lines of
