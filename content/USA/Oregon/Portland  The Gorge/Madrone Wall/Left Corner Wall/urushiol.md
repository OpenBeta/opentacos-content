# Description
Bouldery moves up through some funky holds and into the notch below the roof. Trust the flake and step left, getting your hands into the crack and smearing your feet in a small dish. Contort yourself and step left, reaching for the far-off jug. Latch it, make a fun rock-over around the corner, and layback up to a stance. Continue up the tight-hands crack to another stance below the overhanging hand crack in the dihedral. Enjoy this sensational but all-too-short section of bliss until it ends at a nook with a good stemming stance.

# Location
Far left margin of the wall, obvious overhang crack traverse up to a hanging dihedral

# Protection
Gear to 3", two bolts, anchor with rap rings
