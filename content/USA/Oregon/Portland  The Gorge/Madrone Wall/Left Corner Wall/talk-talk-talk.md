# Description
Captivating, majestic, inspiring: these are not adjectives you are likely to hear when people bring up

Talk, Talk, Talk.

A brutal little climb that will have you regretting that salad you skipped in favor of pizza and cider the night before. Lithe boulderers

with crimping skills will do well, most others will get spanked. Myself included.

Between the dirtyness, enhanced hold, and condensed climbing, I though 1.5 stars was about right. Certainly let me know if you think otherwise.

# Location
Far right side of Left Corner Wall, a blunt arete just as you come down the hill and around the corner from

Verbal

and the Orange Wall.

# Protection
bolts
