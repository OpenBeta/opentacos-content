# Description
Stick-clip the high first bolt. Boulderers will especially enjoy the wild, overhanging sequence up onto the face. From here, the real difficulties begin. Work your way out right, somehow working those feet up onto the good features. The holds are tiny but obvious, just piece together the brief but delicate sequence, and don't blow the strenuous clip. Latch the "jugs" and then join with

Into the Black

, which should be a breeze after you've pulled those moves! Just don't forget to bring some gear!

# Location
Middle face of Left Corner Wall, right of the low overhang of

Identity Crisis

, left of the piton-protected left-trending crack of

Into the Black

# Protection
3 bolts, a 3/4 or 1 inch cam, anchor with rap rings
