# Description
Get up into a wide slot and shimmy your way up as it narrows dramatically. Plug good gear before launching into the thin crux sequence. At a stance above this, feather in small gear before pulling through the tenuous slabby section to another stance. A few easy moves and you're at the anchor.

Sheesh

(10c, spicy gear) to the right can be setup for top-rope from the same anchor.

# Location
The very obvious deep corner at the far left of the cliff. Climbs the left side of the Left Corner Wall's main face.

# Protection
Gear to 2", anchor with rap rings
