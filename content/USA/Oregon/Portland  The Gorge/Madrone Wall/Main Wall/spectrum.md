# Description
Technical and a bit reachy. Work your way up the back of the alcove, making a tricky move left to exit the roof on mediocre feet. Find a stance and clip the first bolt. Exhale. A few more powerful moves brings you to a small shelf. Head up and left to the lower anchor. For full value, step right from the anchor and continue up the arete through two more bolts to arrive on a higher ledge with bolted anchor. Extensions adds ~30 feet.

# Location
Start in the deep, roofed alcove between Rising Desperation and Catharsis

# Protection
Gear to 1.5" and bolts. Both sets of anchors are bolted with rap rings.
