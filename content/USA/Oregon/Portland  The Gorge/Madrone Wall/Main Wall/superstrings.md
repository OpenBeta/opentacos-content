# Description
This is a stout sport route that takes you into some good crimping territory and a sweet 100% pure bouldering move in the middle. That's the crux, but the route doesn't let up just yet.

# Location
Immediately right of Catharsis

# Protection
Four bolts and an anchor with mussy hooks for easy lowering.
