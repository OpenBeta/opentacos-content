# Description
This route is comparable by most measures- height, difficulty, quality- to its nearby neighbor, Ant Abuse. The advantage of it having a bolt at its crux is possibly offset by it's heads-up climbing off the ground to the first bomber protection. After that it takes gear nicely where it's wanted most.

# Location
35 feet right of where the North trail arrives at the cliff, between Double Dutch Right and Pillow Talk, the lone bolt on the route identifies both its location and its crux.

# Protection
A few runners advised to manage the rope line. BD .3 to 3 with doubles in .5 to 2 should be plenty. A ball nut might give some peace of mind a few feet below the first bomber placement, which is quite high.
