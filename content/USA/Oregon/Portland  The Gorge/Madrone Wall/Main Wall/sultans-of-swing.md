# Description
A very runout start up a minor corner with positive edges brings you to a stance on a sloping ledge. Clip the first bolt and step left - don't get sucked up the featureless groove on the right. Very small edges and tip-toeing gets you the flake. Climb this and make a hard pull on top of it. From here, join

Scotty Hits the Warp Drive

and climb the left-trending hand crack to another stance, and then back right up the final layback crack to the anchor ledge.

# Location
Just left of

Double Dutch

, on the left side of the obvious prow in the middle of the Main Wall, where the main trail comes up

# Protection
Gear to 2" and 3 bolts
