# Description
Follow the obvious crack up and left from the Superstrings anchor. Moderate climbing leads to a very well protected crux pulling the bulge. Mostly a one-sequence-wonder but what a sequence it is!

Enjoy moderate climbing after the crux to a bolted anchor and an exposed lower off where you realize just how steep the route really was.

# Location
Up and left from the Superstrings Anchor (Catharsis 2nd anchor). Can't miss it.

# Protection
Pro to 2"
