# Description
Fine, I’ll add it! (Hahaha)

Fire up the overhanging wall below the rising desperation anchors. Burly moves lead to a thin Crux, then yell really loud and huck—if you stick, you’re a star.

# Location
Bolt line direct down from rising desperation anchors.

# Protection
QDs, 5 and anchors.
