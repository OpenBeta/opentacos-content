# Description
A short route, but packs a punch. Clammer up to the ledge at the base of the crack. Easy climbing quickly steepens to a wide crux as you jam your way through and up to the anchor.

# Location
15 feet left of Hungry for Duress, at the highest point in the trail of this section. Choose whichever way looks least mossy to attain the ledge.

# Protection
Gear to 3.5" (#3 in BD C4)
