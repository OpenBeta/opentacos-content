# Description
A really straight forward route by basalt standards that is fun and well protected.  Begin up the left side of the arete on good holds, clip the first bolt, then do some reaches between ledges.  At the third bolt, traverse left via edges and get under the short flared crack in the roof.  A short, powerful boulder problem takes you to a jug.  If you yell, "crimpa crimpa," letting your voice get real high on the "a" you will definitely hit the jug, but no guarantees after that.  Super!
