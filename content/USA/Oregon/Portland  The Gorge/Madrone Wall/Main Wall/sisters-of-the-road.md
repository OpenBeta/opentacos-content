# Description
Climb up a crack in a dihedral then move left into another crack below a pod. Pull into and through the pod and then get through a tricky move just below all the guano/bird droppings. Pin was gone as of Dec 2017.

# Location
Not far to the right of Ant Abuse, look for the "obvious" pod halfway up the climb

# Protection
Gear to 2" (my partner found a spot for a #3 but I didn't use one)
