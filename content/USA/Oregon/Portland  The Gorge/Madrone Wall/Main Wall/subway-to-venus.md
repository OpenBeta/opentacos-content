# Description
An insanely unrelenting arete that pulls through micro crimps, wild slaps, and tension lie-backs - Subway to Venus packs a big punch in a really short pitch.  Begin off the anchors for Double Dutch Left (you can clip the first bolt from the ledge), then get to the best hold on the route (a one-pad edge) to clip the second bolt and start pulling hard.  This route could either be the hardest 5.12a in all of Oregon, or a few grades harder ;) The 5.12 grade given allows you to pick whatever letter grade you want to fill in after!  Fun, hard, short.

# Location
Start of the Double Dutch Ledge via Double Dutch Left

# Protection
5 bolts
