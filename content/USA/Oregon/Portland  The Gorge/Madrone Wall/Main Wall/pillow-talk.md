# Description
A popular and fun little climb on a clean section of rock. Several minor cruxes lead to a powerful reach above the last bolt. Stepping right in to the Ant Abuse dihedral at the last bolt reduces the grade and the fun.

# Location
In front of a leaning madrone tree.

# Protection
3 bolts + fixed anchor
