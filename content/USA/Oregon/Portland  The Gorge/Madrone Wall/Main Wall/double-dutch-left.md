# Description
Begin just right of Sultan's of Swing and climb easy blocks through ledges for the first two bolts.  Get onto a large ledge above the second bolt and commit left, out onto the face.  Climb the short dihedral section, placing a #4 metolius and a #1 metolius (you can also place a small nut before committing to the face off the ledge).  A neato, but tricky mantle gets you onto the Double Dutch Ledge and to the anchors.  A super dooper double dutch pitch!

# Location
About twenty feet right at the top go the approach trail.

# Protection
2 bolts, metoius cams #1-4, one or two small stoppers.
