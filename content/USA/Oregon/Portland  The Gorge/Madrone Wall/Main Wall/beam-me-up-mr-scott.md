# Description
If this sweet line weren't situated next to Scott Free, it'd have a whole lot more positive press.

Begin up the steep face on holds that look like great incut jugs.  Some are, some aren't.  The first three bolts are surprisingly strenuous.  Get a shake on the ledge, place some pro, and fire a cool technical crux.  Keep your head, fight through some more pump and maybe put in another piece to protect the last couple moves between the last bolt and the anchor.

# Location
Left side of the main wall.  One route left of Scott Free in that cool alcove with fantastic red and brown striated rock. Look for a fairly generous ledge three bolts up, currently sporting a quick link.

# Protection
5 Quickdraws (+2 for anchors), a few cams (0.5-1.5") for the runout after the third bolt and after the last bolt. Rap rings, 2 bolt anchor.
