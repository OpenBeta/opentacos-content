# Description
A fairly committing lead,

Mr Noodle Arm

has one significant loose block you pull on at mid-height and then step on, and another just above that you must grapple with. It will leave you questioning gravity - I have no idea how it is even attached...moss-glue maybe?

The climbing is fun and involves a little bit of everything from awesome finger locks to crimping, from steep to slab, and the gear is good, but the rock is, um, well, rocky at times. Just tread lightly. Same anchor as

Time to Kill

.

R because of the big block that hums to you when you step or pull on it.

# Location
At the far right end of the wall, two climbs (counting Full Spank Mode) to the left of Full Spank Mode.

# Protection
Mixed.  3 bolts.  Metolius cams from #2 - #6.  Helmet?
