# Description
On top of a wide rock platform, an alcove on the left side of the area features a dihedral/corner crack. The upper section is often overgrown and could use cleaning. A tree lies above for rappelling or lowering as you see fit. This is obviously not ideal so consider that if you want to try to bail to the anchor nearby

# Location
Walking toward the Orange Wall, before you get to meat and potatoes, you'll see a short upward trail on your right towards to a short wall. Go up. To the left is a wide rock platform featuring this singular climb
