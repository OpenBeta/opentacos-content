# Description
Start up the left side of the blunt arete, making relatively easy moves up to the high first bolt. Find the edges and pull hard, making sure not to blow the second clip. Crux it past this onto the face, look around the corner if it seems impossible. From a stance, make easier moves through a minor runout to the anchors.

# Location
The obvious, sheltered prow beneath the overhangs in the middle of this small section of cliff

# Protection
3 bolts, anchor (all original 3/8") with aluminum carabiners for lowering off
