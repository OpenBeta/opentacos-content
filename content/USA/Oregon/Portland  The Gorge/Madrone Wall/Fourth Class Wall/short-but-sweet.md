# Description
Scramble into the square-shaped alcove, trending towards the break in the left side. Squirm awkwardly up this to a horizontal break. Fiddle in gear where you can. Stem up on small edges to a leftward step and a bolt (phew). Hope that block on your left is solid and make a few sporty moves up to the ledge.

# Location
Middle of this section, the weakness up the right side of the arete and through the upper overhangs

# Protection
Gear to 1.25", 1 bolt, anchor with rap rings
