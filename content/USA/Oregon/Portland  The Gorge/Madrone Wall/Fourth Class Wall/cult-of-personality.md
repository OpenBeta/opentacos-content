# Description
Stick-clip the first bolt or use a small cam (1/2") early. Start up into a minor dihedral with lots of small chips wedged in. Once at the minor roof, get your feet up and gracefully lean out. Pull hard onto the face, and keep it together as you kick back right. Slap your way up the square-cut arÃªte, finding feet to the right where you can. Pull around the upper roof then grab jugs up a dirty corner to the anchor. Check out those cool relics!

# Location
Right-most bolted line on this section of the wall

# Protection
4 bolts, anchor with rap rings
