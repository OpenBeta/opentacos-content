# Description
Do the direct start to Tangerine Dream, a little grovelly, and then edge through a short but spectacular face section.  Shake out at a flake jug before committing to the crux bulge.

Here you can power up to the "knob-pocket" and head left, using a sloping series of rails and a heal hook to gain a big flake, or more straight up from the "knob-pocket" doing a mantle/press to a sloping ball-crimp.  Either way is hard!  Like really hard!

Rest a bit and end in the shallow dihedral via lock-offs, lie-backing, and keeping your freshly noodled arms in check.  Don't fall clipping the anchors - that would be heart breaking.

# Location
Right of Tangerine Dream.

# Protection
Bolts.  Retro bolted since first ascent.
