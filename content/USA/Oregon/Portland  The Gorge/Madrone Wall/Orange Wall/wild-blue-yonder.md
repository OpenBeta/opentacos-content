# Description
This route starts by heading up the left curving crack about 5' left of the start for Wild Things. Work your way up slightly awkward, but cool moves through the crack until you can access a small stance just left of the roof. From there, pull steep moves on awesome jugs past two bolts and a few gear placements until you reach a roof below the anchors. Pull into the slot to get to the anchors.

# Location
Starts 5' left of Wild Things, goes around to the left and above the big roof.

# Protection
Gear to 3", 2 bolts
