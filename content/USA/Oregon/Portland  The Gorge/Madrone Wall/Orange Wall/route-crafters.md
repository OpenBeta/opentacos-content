# Description
Popular for its bolts and grade. Start up an easy ramp to a stance below a bulge. Clip and step left on small holds and swing up to a ledge. Stem up on big edges to another clip and pull onto the next ledge. Wander up and right around the prow and onto another ledge (avoid the poison oak). The climbing gets better as you trend back left and up a minor slot and finish on thin crack holds and slabby feet to a precarious stance at the anchors.

# Location
Left of the big overhang that separates it from Cornick's Corner

# Protection
6 bolts, anchors with rap rings
