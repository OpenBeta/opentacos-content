# Description
This is a fun line, and worth doing. Start off the pointy boulder and pull onto the face (this is hardest move to commit to IMO). Work up to the crack above the roof and place gear there and pull over it to the stance where you can clip the bolt. Then follow the left leaning dihedral and face moves, placing gear where possible until you reach the anchors shared with Wild Things.

# Location
Just right of Wild Things (shares anchor).

# Protection
Gear from 0.2-2", 2 bolts, anchor with mussy hook lower-offs
