# Description
The obvious left-leaning dihedral line on the right side of the Orange Wall. Funky movement over tiny gear takes you around the thin cracks and eventually a very tenuous move back left at the bolt. From here, pull hard through overhanging jugs and run it out to the ledge (belayer ready for big fall). Feather in some gear behind the flake, then move up through some fun features on dirty, slabby rock. Slither up a slot and onto the anchor pedestal shared with

Midget Madness

.

# Location
