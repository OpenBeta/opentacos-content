# Description
Orange Menace is a steep sport  line just left of the classic Comfortizer.  To start, move through the first bolt of Comfortizer, then step left to follow four bolts, one grey and three brown hangers up the steep arete.  From the second bolt move through a balancy and hard to decipher overhang. Then move right and up to the giant fin passing a bolt along the way.  From here move up and left on good holds, clipping another bolt, until you reach the headwall. Thin, balancy, and tricky climbing lead past the final bolt to a jug.  Easy moves take you  to the anchor.

# Location
This route starts either at Comfortizer or to the left.
