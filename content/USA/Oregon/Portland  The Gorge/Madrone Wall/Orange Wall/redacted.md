# Description
A phenomenal line that was apparently put up as, essentially, a free-solo through the crux first half. Start up left of the arete until you quickly encounter the first bouldery crux. Step right on these cool, small features. Continue straight up on positive edges, through the blocky horizontals to a stance below the right-trending seam. Pull through this to the hold at the lip and proceed to figure out the mantel move. Continue from here up the dirty, chunky, but fun crack to the top of the pedestal.

# Location
Just left of the obvious arete that delineates the right-most margin of "main" section of the Orange Wall.

# Protection
3 bolts, gear to 1.5" (nuts especially useful for upper half), anchor with lower-off rings.
