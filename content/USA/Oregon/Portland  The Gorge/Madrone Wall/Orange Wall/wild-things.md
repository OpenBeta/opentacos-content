# Description
Likely the best sport route at the crag, and one of the best of the grade in the greater Portland area. Start on vertical rock with incuts up to a high first bolt and a sudden steepening. Big jugs through a massive overhang set you up for a sudden, dynamic, technical crux just below the lip. Keep it together as you pull through the overhang and onto the face, where it joins

Tangerine Dream

. Slight runout through easier climbing to the anchors.

Full name is "Where the Wild Things Roam" but that's just too long for casual conversation.

# Location
Left side of the wall. Look for the steep, overhanging corner with the chalked up jugs.

# Protection
5 bolts, anchor with mussy hook lower-offs
