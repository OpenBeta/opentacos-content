# Description
The crux comes early on as you move through a tricky sequence of pinches utilizing a well placed drop knee. This continues until the 4th bolt where you meet up the Warm Up's "good" pinch jug. Continue straight up from here using decent pinches and underclings. A small gaston at the 7th lets you get just enough back to push through the next two clips. Endurance is the key to sending this line.

# Location
Left of the Warm Up. Same start at Held down.

# Protection
9 bolts to a fixed anchor
