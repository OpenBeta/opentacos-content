# Description
Begin with a double hands double heels on a slacktite. Move into a series of sidepulls using OK edges. The crux is moving off of two sloper at midway to an OK undercling, followed by a series of lockoff gastons. The climbing doesn't ease from there, as it remains extremely pumpy all the way to the anchors.
