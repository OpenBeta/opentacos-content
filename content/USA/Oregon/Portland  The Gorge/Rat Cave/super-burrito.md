# Description
The next logical step after the warm up. Begin up a small pillar to the face. Make a long lockoff to the second bolt and clip. Reach to a small cut out triangle and undercling, back step and lockoff. Another undercling lockoff awaits before you reach the first set of anchors (12c). Continue to the top of the warm up.

# Location
First route left of the warm up.
