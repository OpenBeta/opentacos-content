# Description
Identify this route by the scary-looking detached block 40' feet up. I've pulled on it and it seems to be wedged in there pretty good but be careful. The route features a technical lower section and a punchy and enjoyable crux where the two permadraws hang. It continues into a dihedral, where unfortunately rock quality sharply declines.

# Location
The line that arches left above Immigrant Song.

# Protection
Bolts. Currently there are two crux permadraws.
