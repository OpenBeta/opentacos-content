# Description
Wildly exposed overhanging corner to a distinct roof. A few v6ish boulders interspersed with good kneebar rests, culminating in savage (for me) v7/8 boulder at the top. Brilliant!

# Location
Start on Blood Eagle, in the middle of the main wall. Before the first BE roof, clip a bolt to the left and head that direction. Tech/thrutch your way up the corner and out the giant fang, then head right through the steeps as per Pantheon.

# Protection
Permas.
