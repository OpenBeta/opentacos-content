# Description
Valkyrie into Warlord into the top of the Heathen Project. Amazing bouldering between good kneebars.

I'm not sure that a 60m will make it down from the anchor.

# Location
Starts on Valkyrie.

# Protection
Fixed draws. I placed a long sling on the second Warlord bolt. The anchor over the lip creates a bunch of drag when pulling your rope, so it might be advisable Â to unclip the anchor and take a winger.
