# Description
Climb the first bulge of Blood Eagle and then cut right. Another boulder problem leads to a good kneebar, than a tensiony underling-pinch sequence into a crimp crux. This route has a lot of rad sequences and--if you're used to the typical Viento trickery--a lot of comparatively normal rock climbing.

# Location
Starts on Blood Eagle

# Protection
Bolts and fixed draws.
