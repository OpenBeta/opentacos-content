# Description
“It’s Not Awful” is a contender for Viento’s best 5.11.  This long, quality line has a bit of everything, with plenty of great movement and position.

Pull through the first couple bolts past a bulge, to a stance.  Pass a few more bolts and avoid the toxic ooze in the crack.  Bust left after

the 6th bolt and tackle a short overhang on incut jugs before reestablishing yourself on the face.  Enjoy the long, thought-provoking trip to the chains.

# Location
Past the waterfall, just beyond the belay area for "The Warmup" and "Ithika" find the last two lines at the crag.  "It's Not Awful" is the route that begins directly up the middle of the face and

breaks left after the 6th bolt to surmount a small roof.

A variant called "Really, It's Not Awful" continues straight up after the 6th bolt and ends a little lower on the cliff.

# Protection
16 bolts plus a 2-bolt anchor with rappel rings. Requires a full 60m rope to reach the ground.
