# Description
Choss ramp leads to steep and burly feature climbing. As close to a World Cup comp boulder as you are likely to get sport climbing. Clipping bolt 4 may be the crux. Of the three routes sharing this start, this one cuts left after bolt five into the mind-bending slab corner.

# Location
Most easily identified by the giant "fang" of rock which you traverse onto to finish.

# Protection
Bolts and chain draws.
