# Description
The bottom of Stone Soup, one linkup bolt, and then the last bolt of Feast or Famine. This is a bit of a silly linkup, but gives 5.12 climbers another chance to climb on the big blocks.

I traversed below the linkup bolt on good kneebars, did a big move to the Feast crimp, then a powerful sequence to the Feast jugs/anchor. I'm sure shorter climbers will have to find another way to get to the Feast crimp than what I did.

Could be done all the way up to the Stone Soup anchor, which would definitely add a star and may get you to 13a.

# Location
Starts on Stone Soup, which has three very long starting draws.

# Protection
Fixed.
