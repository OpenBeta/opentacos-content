# Description
Direct finish to the Berserker Project, up to the top of the wall.

Regrettable chossy start to a thuggy roof, sequestered slab, then powerful sidepulling to the top.

# Location
The third route on the far left side of the cliff. Between Dead in the Water and Twister.

# Protection
Fixed draws.
