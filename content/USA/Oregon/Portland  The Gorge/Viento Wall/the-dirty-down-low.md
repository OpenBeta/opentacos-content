# Description
Head up the right side of the face on sharp black rock.  Take a rest at the choss band after fourth before launching into the odd left-facing, gentle overhang.  Top out on the “moss couch” ledge and grab a nice no-hands.

Climb two bolts of satisfying slab and gear up for the crux enduro-run to the chains.

These last four bolts resemble the harder portions on Shield Maiden or The Big Ulysses, where endurance and sequence are key.  The fact that this section is shorter is the only reason for the lower grade.

# Location
Past the waterfall, just beyond the belay area for "The Warmup" and "Ithika" find the last two lines at the crag.  "The Dirty Down Low" is the right bolt line of the two on this face.  It trends a little rightward into an overhanging patch of spiked black rock.

# Protection
15 bolts plus a 2-bolt anchor with rappel rings.
