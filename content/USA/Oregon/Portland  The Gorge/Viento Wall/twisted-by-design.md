# Description
Right-hand extension to Twister (the left extension is Stormchaser). After resting on the no-hands ledge, The climbing starts fairly moderate and gradually gains difficulty, culminating in a punchy crux guarding the chains.

You may want to employ some rope management tricks to reduce drag on the upper section. You can easily go in direct on the ledge without weighting weighting the anchor and ruining your redpoint. Options from there include switching to a second rope or pulling your rope up through the draws and throwing it down to be put back on belay.

# Location
An obvious half-moon of draws. The tallest route on the left side of the main wall.

# Protection
Bolts and fixed draws.
