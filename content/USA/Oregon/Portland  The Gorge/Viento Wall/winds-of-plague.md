# Description
Clocking in at 5.12- this route might come across as low hanging fruit at a crag stacked with hard [wo]man routes; but make no mistake, this technically challenging and cryptic rig demands your full attention.

Winds of Plague is thought provoking- having very few downward pulling holds. Â It requires interesting body position, hip scumming and/or knee bar tom foolery.

"Never will you have more fun on a two and a half star 40 foot sport route" - Dan Bookless

# Location
Immediately to the left of Dead in the Water- very near where the approach trail meets the wall
