# Description
A tricky sequence getting established on columns leads to a good stance. The wall tips back and some sustained crimping gets you to the first anchor. This has become the go-to warm up for the steeper lines.

I believe there is a second pitch/extension. I'm happy to update this if anyone adds into, I have not climbed it.

# Location
The left line between the twin maple trees.

# Protection
Bolts. Fixed draws on to the first anchor.
