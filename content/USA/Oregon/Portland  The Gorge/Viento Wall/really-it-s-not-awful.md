# Description
This solid, long line tells the truth with its name.  "Really, It's Not Awful" is quite a decent route, that, with more traffic should clean up nicely.  Just avoid the crack seeping that radioactive green ooze.

Pull through the first couple bolts past a bulge, to a stance.  Then straight up on slightly overhanging terrain, boasting of interesting holds and body positions.  Surmount a second bulge, shake and tackle the final face.  A few novel surprises await as you close in on the chains.

# Location
Past the waterfall, just beyond the belay area for "The Warmup" and "Ithika" find the last two lines at the crag.  "Really, It's Not Awful" is the route that goes directly up the middle of the face, staying right of the seeping crack.

A variant called "It's Not Awful" breaks left after the 6th bolt and tackles some steeper terrain and runs a few more bolts further up the cliff.

# Protection
Lots of quickdraws (15?)
