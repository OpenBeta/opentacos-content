# Description
Formerly the corner project. Cool boulder with crimps, stems, layback moves, and techy kneebars. Loses a star for being a bit crumbly and sharp.

Big thanks to Odin Grano for bolting the direct start, cleaning it, figuring out 90% of the beta, and then graciously letting me snake the FA.

# Location
Start in the same spot as Valhalla, but cut right to clip the first bolt.

# Protection
Fixed.
