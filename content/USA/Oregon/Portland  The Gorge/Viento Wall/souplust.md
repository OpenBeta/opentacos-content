# Description
The new crux beta on Stone Soup puts you right next to some Bloodlust holds, so this linkup was begging to get done. Basically replaces the no-hands stem/12+ SS headwall with the crux of BL.

Do most of the Stone Soup crux moves, cutting right to some jugs where you would normally go for the SS meathook. I hung a mega-draw on the next bolt on BL--three down from the chains, I think. You end up pretty far from your last bolt before getting to clip it.

# Location
Starts on Stone Soup, with the mega long starting draws.

# Protection
Fixed draws.
