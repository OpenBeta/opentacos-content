# Description
A new 5-bolt direct start to Ragnarok/Asgard. You can finish on either route. Finishing on Rag is probably easier, but Asgard is higher quality.

Climbs up a neat-looking angular feature on the slab before moving left into a severe overhang on – you guessed it – underclings and kneebars. The crux involves navigating the axeblade hold and doing some powerful moves to establish yourself in the Ragnorak rest.

# Location
Starts on some choss below a vertical weakness on the slab, about 10' left of the Ragnarok slab.

# Protection
Bolts
