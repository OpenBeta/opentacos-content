# Description
A enjoyable and varied route. The short pillar leads to steeper climbing on good holds--the best intro to the cryptic blocky style of the main wall. After a no-hands rest in the break, pull onto the face for a thin and sustained ride to the chains. Perhaps the most popular 5.12 at the cliff.

# Location
Starts on a slb pillar with three bolts on it.

# Protection
Bolts and fixed draws.
