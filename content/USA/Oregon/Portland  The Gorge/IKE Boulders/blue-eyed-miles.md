# Description
See the route guide for the pioneer boulder. Starts both hands on the lower rail. First move is a slap out to the right arete. Then move up to the crimp. Stand up into the sloper and lean out far to grab the lip up left. finishes on the same holds as Insane in Elaine. Definitely the most fun problem in the P-Ike area.

# Location
Looking from the road, the pioneer boulder is the farthest left of the rocks. Hike up to the Bus boulder and go slightly down and left and youll see it.

# Protection
one pad and a good spotter just in case you slip on the mantle.
