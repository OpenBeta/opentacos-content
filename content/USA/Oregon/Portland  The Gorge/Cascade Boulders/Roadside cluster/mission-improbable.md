# Description
Start on two low edges, pull on, reach for the slopey crimp thing and go for the jug. The mantle is pretty tricky too. Might want to warm up your fingers.

# Location
Right below the talus (the small boulder wit the holdless slab) past the first two boulders. A little bushwacking will get you there.

# Protection
1 pad.
