# Description
This is a lonesome and short sport route off the road before the entrance of Scoggins Park/Henry Hagg Lake. Only worthwhile if you are very close in proximity, on the way to the lake, or itching to explore. Still, it is nice to know there is rock out this way. Perhaps there is more rock to be found up by the lake to explore.

Full Disclaimer: I don't know the grade, name, or FA party of this route. It has been about a decade since I've visited the location and memory is hazy.

My best guess is the route is in the range of 5.8 to 5.10 but again, I don't know the exact difficulty rating. MP requires a grade input so route is listed as "3rd."

Rock type is reminiscent of the type found at Carver cliffs.

I remember the bolts being very shiny and new looking (around 2012). The pictures are within the past few years, and the anchors are still there, looks like 2 screw gate ovals. I cannot attest to the current safety of the rock or the bolts.

*If any updates/problems/access issues exist please message me to be fixed.

The brush at the base of the route looks cleared in the pictures, by contrast to the outlying brush, so this route still gets some traffic by all appearances.

Also be mindful of poison oak/ivy in the area.
