# Description
Route starts with a 4th-class scramble up the left and curves to the right where you can find two sets of bolted anchors. There is now a single bolt along the way before reaching the chains. The older ones on the left is where most start or you can choose to move over to the newer ones, and begin their trad climb up and to the right in the obvious rock gulch; continuously curving rightwards. Towards the top you hit a ridge and cut back left to the anchor chains. Trad pitch is approximately 70 feet in length.

Can be rapped with double 60m ropes all the way back to the trail[50s barely touch the ground]; although be very wary since it has a tendency to get stuck[bring the knot over the lip, and flake the two strands in seperate notches]. Can also be done with two rappels using the intermediate anchors.

# Location
In front of the tree. Obvious scramble to first anchor.

# Protection
Pro to 2" ; Bolted Anchor after 4th class scramble. Second new bolted anchor to its right. Anchor with rappel chains at the top.
