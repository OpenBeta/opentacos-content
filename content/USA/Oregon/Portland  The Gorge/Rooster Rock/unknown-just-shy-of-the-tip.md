# Description
Instead of the 4th class scrambling going up and to the left, there is a set of 8 bolts that get you directly to the new bolted anchors mid-way.  The route is a bit dusty in bits, but the rock makes for easy step-ups between clips. To climb the rest of it, see the Classic route's description. [Route only showed up recently, would love to credit whoever put it up as well as it's proper name]

# Location
Right in front of the right tree, to the right of the classic scramble

# Protection
8 Bolts to anchor.
