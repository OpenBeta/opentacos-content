# Description
Climb straight up chalked (interesting) holds. Traverse right around 15' to step on top of a bulge (this is the crux). Climb straight up small jugs and big feet. Head left at the large flake. Above the flake, straighten out, using jugs for your left hands and crimps for your right. Then, just a few easy moves to the anchor. Fairly sustained and aerobic climbing - 9+/10a pretty much the whole route. A nice long and fun line for the Butte. Do it.

# Location
Right side of "Lower Warrior Wall", obvious bolt line that weaves its way up the slabby-to-vertical slice of beautiful rock.

# Protection
Bolts, anchor with lower-off rings
