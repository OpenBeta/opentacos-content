# Description
You’ll Dance To Anything is an interesting climb that ascends a less-than-vertical face. Somewhat like Edge of Might, it doesn’t take a lot of brawn to get up this thing. The start is fun arête slapping and face climbing. Get into the shallow dihedral and take a rest. Reach left around the arête to clip the last bolt. Cut left and enjoy the short, technical crux just below the anchor.

# Location
Just right of Crack Warrior.

# Protection
Bolts + fixed anchor. Make use of the belay bolt...it’s a long ways down.
