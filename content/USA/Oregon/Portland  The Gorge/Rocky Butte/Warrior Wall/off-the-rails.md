# Description
Off the Rails starts in the obvious finger crack a couple feet off the Guardrail Descent Trail.  The crux sequence through the bulge could be a bit tricky for those climbing at this grade.  A couple bolts for the upper section and anchor chains may be added later.

# Location
Far west end of Warrior Wall.

# Protection
Top-rope tree anchor is a couple steps down the

access trail

to the Emotional Rescue top-rope anchor.
