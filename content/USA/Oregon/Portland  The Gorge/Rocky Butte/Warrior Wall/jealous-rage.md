# Description
Looking at Jealous Rage, it’s hard to believe that it’s an 11c. Once you get on though those doubts will be gone. A cryptic climb that will have you constantly looking for something a little bit better. It seems like that good foot or good hand is often just out of reach. The punchy section only lasts for about twenty feet though, until joining up with Arch Nemesis.

Be very cautious about yarding on the four foot block at the base of the fir tree. It is completely detached and seems to be ready to go.

# Location
Next climb left of Emotional Rescue.

# Protection
Two bolts + gear to 2”. Bolted anchor next to the fir tree.

Alternatively, with directionals Jealous Rage can be top-roped from the upper Emotional Rescue anchor.
