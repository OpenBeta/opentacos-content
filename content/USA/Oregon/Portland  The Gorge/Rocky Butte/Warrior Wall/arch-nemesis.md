# Description
Starting in a fairly blank dihedral, Arch Nemesis is hard from the get-go. The technical crux is a fun challenge but doesn’t last long. After about twenty feet of tricky stemming you’ll get to a long traverse to the right. The climbing from here on out is much less difficult but fun nonetheless. Cut right, grabbing huge jug underclings until you can join the arching flake. Follow the arching flake until it makes sense to bust out onto the face for a short stint just below the anchor.

Be very cautious about yarding on the four foot block at the base of the fir tree. It is completely detached and seems to be ready to go.

# Location
Left of Emotional Rescue

# Protection
Gear to 2”. Bolted anchor next to the fir tree.

For top-roping, there’s a piton high in the dihedral that is convenient to use as a directional.
