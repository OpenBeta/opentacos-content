# Description
Crack Warrior is the eye catching dihedral on the right side of the the Warrior Wall.  The climbing starts on a relatively easy face.  Around the fifteen foot mark a dihedral begins to form; at this point the crux kicks in.  Desperately try to stick some flaring pin scars while standing on nothing substantial.  If you can get into the dihedral you'll be rewarded with some good shakes.  The remainder of the climb is less severe though fatigue could still spoil your plans.
