# Description
Start with a funky double crack that forces you to layback. A long reach makes it easier; harder for shorter folks. Once in the crack, climb this until you reach the pruned shrub and step right onto the face. Moderate climbing on sloping crimps and smears and one tricky move takes you to the anchors.

If coming at this from above, you have to duck under the boulder above the

Crack Warrior

chain anchor. Use the backup bolt to traverse under this until you are situated on the wide ledge above this route.

# Location
Right side of the Far East Wall ledge, but somehow considered a part of Warrior Wall. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Protection
pro to 2"
