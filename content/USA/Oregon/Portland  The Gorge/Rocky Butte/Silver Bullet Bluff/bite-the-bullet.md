# Description
Does it count as 'chipping' if you're climbing bullet holes?  Someone went to town on this face with a rifle or a big handgun, and the chips that were taken out by the bullets comprise all the holds on the face.

# Location
Start at the tree that's snugged up to the base of the wall.

# Protection
5 bolts and small cams for

Jack of Heart
