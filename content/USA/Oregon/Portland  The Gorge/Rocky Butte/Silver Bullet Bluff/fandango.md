# Description
Interesting climbing to a crux 3/4 of the way up involving either a deadpoint to a jug, or an interesting layback with a heelhook to do it statically. Best line I've climbed on Silver Bullet.

# Location
Furthest right, obvious, line on the main bluff (before the wall turns 90 degrees).

# Protection
Anchor with chains at a ledge at the top which can be accessed from above using a single bolt to safely obtain the anchor ledge (setup a fixed line?).
