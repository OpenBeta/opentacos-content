# Description
Starts on a slab up to a shallow right-facing corner. The last portion merges with Jack of Hearts, which is the thin crack to the left of the corner. Finish up on the ledge with the chain anchors

# Location
Start at the tree in the middle of the wall. Then move about 10 feet right until you spot the corner to the right of the thin crack that is Jack of Hearts. This will be a fair bit to the right of the rightmost chain anchors.

Often mossy, which needs regular cleaning

# Protection
Pro to 1" and poorly protected. Chain anchors up top for a toprope setup.
