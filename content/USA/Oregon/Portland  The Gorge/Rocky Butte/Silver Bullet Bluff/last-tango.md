# Description
a fun crack climb with a overhang blocky section. a final push over a bulge gets to the top.  not as good of a climb as Fandango but still quality

there are two old, but good anchors bolts that you can walk to (or rap to. safety first) from the big ledge, easy to set up and rap down from as well, if a bit sketch.

this climb doesn't get a lot of traffic but most of the holds were moss free and the crack was clean. we did some brushing and moss removal. would recommend standard issue RB wisk broom.

the book gives Last Tango a .10a rating, which i will post and let you all debate. all i am going to say is that nearby Mind Games is also rated a 10.a and is much harder

as a side note. we linked through the fandango anchors as well (easy scramble around boulder) so we could TR both routes. rope drag was manageable.

if leading. takes good pro to 1". small nuts and cams.  maybe a 2" for the top.  pro is plentiful.

good climb on a good wall

# Location
climb starts at vertical finger crack (Technical), 10' climber left of Fandango.  climb up into the corner crack(easy) and then up and out and over the blocky section (strenuous). a few desperate feels around the dirty, sloped top out, before pulling up to the anchors. lower or walk off left to big ledge.  a small scramble will take you to top (called approach trail in Olson's book)

# Protection
takes good pro to 1". small nuts and cams.  maybe a 2" for the top.  pro is plentiful. 2 bolts with some rusty steel oval screw links.
