# Description
An obvious arete paired with a beautiful curving left-facing crack running parallel to a slabby face

# Location
From the bottom, look for the #6 sign on the tree. This climb is found on the corner before you approach that tree.

From above, continue the trail downward past Glenn's route, heading down and leftwards along the rock. Past Centurion, this will be just around the corner on the left.

# Protection
Tree anchor 10-15 feet back from the top
