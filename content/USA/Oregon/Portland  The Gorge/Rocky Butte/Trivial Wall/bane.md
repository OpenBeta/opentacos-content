# Description
The route starts up the slab section of Harlequin. Once you reach the second big hold you go up and left from there. Crux is a little past halfway up moving to a small pocket. Toward the end there is a fun opportunity to use the about fist sized crack to the left to pull into the final top out.

# Location
You find the start of the route either from the main trails and scrambling up to the base of the Trivial wall section or you rappel down from one of the many anchor spots in the area on top.

# Protection
Anchors at top, there are no bolts but some decent spots for some cams, approx 1-1.5" cracks going through the middle section.
