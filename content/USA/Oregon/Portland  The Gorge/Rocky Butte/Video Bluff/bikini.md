# Description
The crux is just past the second bolt, a balancey left-hand friction move to a good ledge.  There are balance moves and power moves, a well rounded route.

# Location
This route follows the bolt line up the buttress to the left of Flakey Old Man, with which it shares a start (and first bolt).

# Protection
4 QD's and a 3-bolt anchor
