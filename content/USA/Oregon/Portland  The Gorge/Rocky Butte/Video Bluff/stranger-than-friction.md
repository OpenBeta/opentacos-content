# Description
This route is the bolted line to the right of Flakey Old Man. It starts with two small pockets, followed by a big move to a sloping ledge. Adequate feet support good hands. This route is super dirty in the early part of the season.

# Location
On the northern section of Video Bluff, to the right of Flakey Old Man.

# Protection
5 quickdraws, and not a bad idea to stick clip the first bolt. The crux is probably the first move, and the landing isn't nice. Can be toproped easily enough.
