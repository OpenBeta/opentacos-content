# Description
Originally named "Zivas Book" in the 1987 Rocky Butte Quarry guidebook. An interesting steep corner climb with balance moves

# Location
If you are at the obvious Flakey Old Man, just to the left you you should see the bolts on Bikini that goes straight up the rounded buttress. It goes up into the left of the butress, topping out in the obvious indentation. There are some obvious chain anchors you can use or there is a tree about 7 feet back you can use for an anchor

# Protection
Chain Anchors at the top. 3 bolts - 1st bolt is pretty high up.  Also a good tree 7 feet back from the ledge
