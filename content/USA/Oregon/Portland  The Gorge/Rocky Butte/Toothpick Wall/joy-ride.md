# Description
This is the bolted face climb just to the right of Blueberry Corner. It starts right below the overhanging roof. After the roof crux, stay to the left of arete. Continue up to the anchors

# Location
If you find the tree at the top of Blueberry Corner (picture shown in the main Toothpick wall page), it will be just to the left of that. From the top, the anchors are not a safe distance to setup a top-rope without being attached to something. From the bottom, its to the right of Blueberry Corner.
