# Description
This general area of Toothpick Wall required extensive cleaning including removal of a couple cooler sized blocks from the Interproximal crack system. The result is a nice addition to the list of quality routes on Toothpick Wall.

Climb the slightly overhanging right facing corner up to a horizontal roof crack capped by a pod.  Work your way into the pod and stay in the same crack system that diagonals slightly to the right.  The climb is a little easier if you use some of the neighboring holds on Social Distancing on the left through the pod section.  Climb over big flakes and ledges and check out the Smart Car sized block suspended overhead.  Rap chains are available here if the block is too unnerving.  Otherwise, continue up the overhanging crack on the left side of the block through another pod and over the top (about 5.9) or alternatively the right side of the block (5.9+).  Climb out of the boulder pit to the tree anchor up by the trail.  Another variation is to go left from the upper pod on face holds (5.10) to a nice finger crack then along an easy ramp up to the Social Distancing tree anchor.

# Location
Central section of Toothpick Wall.

Top-rope option.  Enter Area #2 and walk past the first big tree on the trail (Vertical Therapy anchor) and the second tree (Toothpick anchor) to the third tree along the cliff.  Set up an anchor on this tree. The bottom of the route won't be visible until you rap through the boulder pit to the lip. To top rope the finger crack extension, set the anchor on the fourth tree along the trail (Social Distancing anchor above Joy Ride/Hot Donna). Rap down to a ramp then head in the general direction of PDX. A small cam (about 3/4 inch) in the finger crack is recommended as a directional since the extension cuts left a few feet from the big block.

# Protection
Standard rack up to 4 inches and a 5" cam to protect the last move up the left side of the block.
