# Description
The route starts on the last large stance at the start of Rob's Ravine. Climb a few thin face moves up and left to the edge of the main wall that defines Toothpick and Close to the Edge. Negotiate the crux then climb up to the steep crack on Far from the Edge.  Climb the remaining section using hand holds that make up the right side of the crack and the edge of the main wall.  Or just climb the crack which is fun 5.9.

# Location
Enter Area #2 and walk past the first big tree on the trail (Vertical Therapy anchor) to the second tree (Toothpick anchor).  Set up a top-rope anchor on this tree.
