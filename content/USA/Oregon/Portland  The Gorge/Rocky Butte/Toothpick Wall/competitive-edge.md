# Description
Series of compression and balance moves up the arete

# Location
Arete to the left of Vertical Therapy

# Protection
Bolts + gear. Two bolts at the start, middle section has a few horizontal cracks for gear then one more bolt near the top. Large tree at the top for an anchor or single bolt with rap ring. After the final bolt the final mantle is a bit exposed, it looks like there was one bolt or an anchor chopped at the top. A long sling from the rap bolt at the top could protect the final moves.
