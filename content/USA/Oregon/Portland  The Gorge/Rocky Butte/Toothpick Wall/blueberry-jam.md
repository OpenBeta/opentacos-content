# Description
Blueberry Jam is a steep, clean crack on the left side of the Toothpick Wall.  The traditional start begins to the right of the crack on easy terrain and traverses left on good edges.  Small cams or RP's protect the traverse reasonably well.  An alternate direct-start is bouldery and fun though much more challenging than anything else on the route (bumps the grade up to 5.10a).  Once into the crack the climbing gets really fun. Relatively steep climbing with great jamming and frequent face holds.  Near the top of Blueberry Jam the crack gets wider but also less steep.  Most will run this section out though a C4 #6 can be used.
