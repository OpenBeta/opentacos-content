# Description
A fun climb. Ascend via a crack start then an outside corner until possible to move to the right side of the arete

# Location
Around the corner from Zenith (5.12a), which is the line of bolts on a pretty blank face on the right side of the arete. You should setup your TR on the same tree you might use for your Blueberry Jam anchor.

# Protection
Toprope anchor on a tree up top. Rappel in is easiest
