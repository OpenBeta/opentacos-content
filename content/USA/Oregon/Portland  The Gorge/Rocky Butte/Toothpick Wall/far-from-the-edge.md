# Description
Start just to the left of the arete below the upside-down Y crack. The right branch of that Y is your goal, focusing on the face.Â  A lot of balanced face climbing.

# Location
If you have scrambled down Easy Street, you'll want to take the trail back towards Blueberry Jam. Just keep going past the straight face area that features Toothpick. Once the cliffside starts curving back leftwards, keep an eye for the corner and the upside down Y near the top

# Protection
Same anchors as Toothpick
