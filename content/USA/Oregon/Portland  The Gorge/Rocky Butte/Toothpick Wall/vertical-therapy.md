# Description
Really fun climb and super accessible. good tree for anchor and easy rappel down. Use a directional to avoid getting rope stuck in top crack, which is super annoying when jamming the sweet but all too short hand crack at the top . from this anchor spot you can climb "power surge" just to climber right

# Location
West side of Toothpick Wall. Probably most obvious / well worn location on this wall. Anchor is big tree directly behind top out location. Easy rap down or use cave access to west side of wall. Belay from ground in relatively flat location. beginning of the climb is really more of a scramble up to the true start point about 10' off the ground at ledge

# Protection
book says pro to 3" but its a better TR climb
