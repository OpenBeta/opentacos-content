# Description
This is an easy fat chimney that would work well as a practice climb. More realistically, its a ladder to get between the top and the bottom of the Toothpick Wall

# Location
If you are starting at the bottom, looking for the red bubble letter graffiti on a pillar formation. This is just to the right, in between the pillar and the face. If you are entering from Toothpick, you would get there by walking towards the Blueberry Jam anchor tree and then keep walking straight to the ledge. Then look for the white letter graffiti with a smiley face which will mark the top of the chimney

# Protection
Tree anchor above
