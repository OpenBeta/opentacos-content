# Description
This starts with a wide crescent shaped crack and turns into a wide ledged face with jugs along the way. Crux is the last bit at the top. The oldest guidebooks have this marked as 5.9. Perhaps with some contrived variations to the left or right of the crack, that focus on just the face, you can find that difficulty.

# Location
If you are starting at the bottom, looking for the red bubble letter graffiti on a pillar formation. This is just to the left in the obvious fractured face. Â If you are entering from Toothpick, you would get there by walking towards the Blueberry Jam anchor tree and then keep walking straight to the ledge. Then just eyeball to the middle, between the corner and the gully down-climb.

# Protection
Toprope tree anchor 20 feet from the edge
