A dihedral in between "Far from the Edge" and "Competitive Edge". This will be the dihedral between the slabby face and the right bolted arete that houses Competitive Edge. You can make it more or less difficult by favoring the face. Often dirty and overgrown

# Location
Walk down the #2 trail until you get to the cliffside with a very large tree at the top. On the rocky outcrop along the top, there will be a jagged rock to the right which marks the top

# Protection
Tree anchor up top
