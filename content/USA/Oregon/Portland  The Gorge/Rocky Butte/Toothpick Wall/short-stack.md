# Description
This is a short corner climb that will get you to the top of Toothpick with a bit more effort than the chimney around the other side of the pillar formation with the red bubble letter graffiti at its base. This is a good practice climb and more realistically, its another ladder to get between the top and the bottom of the Toothpick Wall

# Location
If you are starting at the bottom, looking for the red bubble letter graffiti on a pillar formation. This is just to the left, in between the pillar and a face. If you are entering from Toothpick, you would get there by walking towards the Blueberry Jam anchor tree and then keep walking straight to the ledge. Then look for the white letter graffiti with a smiley face and look about 5 feet to the right of that for a gully heading down

# Protection
Tree anchor above
