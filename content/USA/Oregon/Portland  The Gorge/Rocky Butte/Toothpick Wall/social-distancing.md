# Description
Climb the overhanging blocky start to a technical mid-section then finish up in the short flared crack.

# Location
Social Distancing is about 6 feet right of Hot Donna pretty much the entire route.

Top-rope option.  Enter Area #2 and walk past the first big tree on the trail (Vertical Therapy anchor), the second tree (Toothpick anchor), and the third tree (Interproximal anchor) to the fourth tree along the trail.  Set up a top rope anchor on this tree.  Rap down to a ramp then head in the general direction of PDX.

# Protection
Standard trad rack, no bolts.
