# Description
This is a short, fun crack climb, going from fingers to a no-hands leg jam.  There's a good bit of wide crack to contend with at the top (I mean, it's a 30' route, so that's relative), but lots of face holds and crimps within the crack . . . if you want to cheat.  Nice anchor ledge at the top.

# Location
This the obvious crack/dihedral on the left side of the pinnacle, starting on the ledge a short scramble from the trail.  Belayer can stand on the trail.

# Protection
Single rack of cams from .3 to #5.  Don't forget the #5.  Anchors and chains--please lower.
