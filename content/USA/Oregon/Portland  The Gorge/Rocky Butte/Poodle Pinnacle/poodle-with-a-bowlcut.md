# Description
This route is a more moderate variation of Poodle With a Mohawk.  Start up the finger crack until you reach the mini-roof. Instead of the hardman face-climb, reach around the arete to the right and pull yourself up onto the ledge.  Once on the ledge, there is a bolt to protect the move back up and onto the face, where you rejoin the crack.  Jam up the gradually widening fissure--anchors are just right of the crack, under the tree.

As an onsight this feels closer to 5.10a, but do it a couple times or get some more beta and it feels 5.9 . . .

# Location
The right of the two obvious cracks on the pinnacle, though this variation steps right around the arete and onto the ledge before continuing up.

# Protection
Gear to 3" with one bolt.  Anchors and chains installed Oct. 2020, visible from the ground.
