# Description
This is the original route on this formation, put up by Gary Rall in 1987.  starts on gear up the obvious crack below the tree, and continues in a sporty style over the face using one bolt for protection.  Once on the ledge above the bolt, you can finish the climb on gear.

Historical note: 4 inches left of the current bolt hanger, you can see where Gary placed his first on-route bolt, hand-drilled.

# Location
The right of the two obvious cracks on the Pinnacle.  Straight up the face to the tree.

# Protection
Gear to 3" and one bolt.  New anchors with chains installed Oct., 2020.
