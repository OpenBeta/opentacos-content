# Description
The rightmost of the 3 crack-like features that are along this short section of climbing wall. Start below the crescent moon shaped flake, just to the left of the overhanging bloc. Ascend to that flake, continuing up to the wide ledge above

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail trail, there is a short climbing wall to your left. Walk forward to the corner of this wall on the left, with the overhanging block. Look to the left of the block for a crescent moon shaped flake which will mark Passing Lane.

# Protection
Tough spot for a tree anchor
