# Description
Start at the bottom of the crack and up to the anchors. The bottom half is mostly broken ledges until you reach the crack proper. Â Crux is at the top where the crack narrows

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail descent trail, walk past the short climbing wall on your left. If you turn left past the corner you should see the obvious crack marked by some rusty looking chain anchors

# Protection
Chain anchors. Also an awkward tree anchor that is difficult to get to
