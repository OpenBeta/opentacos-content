# Description
Packin' Heat is uncharacteristically steep for the Portland Area.  This Aesthetic line lays siege to the underside of an imposing arete/nose/roof thingy.  Packin' heat demands it all as you pull pockets up a 30 degree overhung wall.

# Location
(see photo) 20 feet left of waterfall (water drainage)

# Protection
maybe 7 bolts
