# Description
This starts with a mantle move, then balancing up a ledge. Pull yourself up two more ledges and finish off with some stemming through a dirty corner. The whole route feels like a series of boulder problems chained together.

# Location
Descend the guardrail trail or, more directly, the Eash Street access point. Find the obvious water drainage line. Look to the right and you see a large ledge about 20 feet up from the broken rock "riverbed" bottom. Claymation starts just at the left side of that ledge in the obvious crack right above a huge flake. Then look one further route right.

From the top, just continue past the Blueberry Jam anchor tree and keep walking along the cliffside. You'll find a trio of trees that can be used as an anchor, about 10 feet back from the top of the route

# Protection
Tree anchor about 10 feet from the route top
