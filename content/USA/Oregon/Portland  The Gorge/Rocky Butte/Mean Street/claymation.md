# Description
A left facing crack that makes its way from bottom to top. The first half is steep, does not offer a lot of foot purchase and much of the crack is flaky and brittle. The upper half, after the bisecting horizontal crack, turns into a shallow dihedral for an easier finish. Some corners in the upper half seem to collect thick mud runoff, lending credence to its name.

# Location
Descend the guardrail trail or, more directly, the Easy Street access point. Find the obvious water drainage line. Look to the right and you see a large ledge about 20 feet up from the broken rock "riverbed" bottom. Claymation starts just at the left side of that ledge in the obvious crack right about a huge flake.

From the top, just continue past the Blueberry Jam anchor tree and keep walking along the cliffside. You'll find a trio of trees that can be used as an anchor, about 15-20 feet back from the top of the route

# Protection
Tree anchors 15-20 feet back from the top of the route
