# Description
Look for the rock scar to the right of the obvious crack and chain anchors that mark Ranger Danger. This route starts below the scar, continues through, and urges you to finish to the right with some nicer sloping ledges. There are bolt anchors on the ledge at the top of the route. There is a solitary tree for a toprope anchor located up top about 20 feet back from the edge

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail descent trail, walk past the short climbing wall on your left. If you turn left past the corner you should see the obvious crack marked by some rusty looking chain anchors. There is a rock scar, almost like a chicken foot mark crushed into the side of the rock. This marks Telegraph Road

# Protection
1 belay bolt. 2 bolts through and a pair of bolt anchors at the top of the route. A tree toprope anchor about 20 feet from the top of the route
