# Description
A thin flakey crack that gives you just enough to work with

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail trail, there is a short climbing wall to your left. This is the first climb on the left, right next to the rocky step ladder. It uses the leftmost of 3 cracks that run through that section of wall

# Protection
Tough spot for a tree anchor
