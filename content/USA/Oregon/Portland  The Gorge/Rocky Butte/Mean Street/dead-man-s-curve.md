# Description
Start at bottom of the lower ledge crack. You will gain to wide ledge with some trees. Move to the right a bit and climb the right-facing crack to the top ledge. The crack is definitely the crux of this route. You might consider lowering and walking back up the guardrail trail because its a 5th class scramble from the top of the ledge back to the large tree anchor

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail trail, continue past the short climbing wall. Further on to the left you'll see the raised ledge with several trees which marks the start of Mean Street. This route starts at the first crack near the corner.

# Protection
Big tree anchor about 35 feet back from the top of the route. You *could* set a redirect on the too small trees right above the ledge
