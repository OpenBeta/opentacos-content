# Description
Incredibly thin crack with a few larger breaks for full hands along the way

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail trail, there is a short climbing wall to your left. This is one crack over from the first crack on your left, right next to the rocky step ladder. It uses the middle of 3 thin cracks that run through that section of wall

# Protection
Tough spot for a tree anchor
