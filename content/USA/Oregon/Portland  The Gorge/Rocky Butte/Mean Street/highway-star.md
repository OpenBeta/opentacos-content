# Description
Left-facing finger crack that might be the best thing in this area. The top portion is the crux, but some flaring in the crack should help. There is a pair of bolt anchors with rusty quick-links at the top. A large silverfish colony seems to spawn around the upper portion of the crack

# Location
Once you have descended the guardrail trail, continue past the short climbing wall. Past the corner, look left for the obvious crack that is Ranger Danger with rusty chain anchors. There will be an rock scar in the middle of the wall, just to the right, which marks Telegraph Road. Continue your eyes right to the next vertical crack. Further right you will see the raised ledge with several trees which marks the start of Mean Street

# Protection
Pro to 1.5
