# Description
White Rabbit follows a wandering, discontinuous seam loaded with pin scars.  The climb is tricky from the start but really kicks into gear around the halfway point.  Unfortunately, silverfish love this climb, especially in the spring time.  Despite the buggyness it's totally worth doing and is likely the third best line on the Breakfast Cracks wall (Birds of Paradise and Blackberry Jam taking the first and second spots respectively).
