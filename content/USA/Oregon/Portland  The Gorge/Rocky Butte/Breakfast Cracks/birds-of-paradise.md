# Description
A fantastic climb on the west (climber's right) side of the Breakfast Cracks wall. Start on a low-angle ramp and gain the finger crack with lots of pin scars. Follow the right-leaning crack until a bulge needs to be negotiated. Once above the bulge, there are some exceptional sidepulls and jugs that are very out of character for basalt. Make a leap of faith and continue going straight up the face making use of these ergonomic holds until reaching the anchor.

# Location
West (climber's right) side of Breakfast Cracks.  If starting at the top, look for an old Metolius rap hanger and button-head bolt.  Back this up with gear in the adjacent cracks.

# Protection
Full set of nuts & a set of small cams (C3s, ect.).
