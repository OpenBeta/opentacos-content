# Description
Climb the arcing traverse crack, clip the bolt, equalize two blue ballnuts in a seam halfway through the techy traverse and then commit to a tricky boulder problem to a jug (crux).

The movement on the traverse is fantastic and the lead is serious stuff - making this an underappreciated route and quite good in my book. Easily TR'd from the Espresso anchor with a directional.

One of several great Rocky Butte head point routes. PG13/R.

# Location
Traversing crack to the right of espresso

# Protection
4 draws, 2 blue ballnuts, 2 one inch cams, rps for initial crack if not stick clipping bolt. Can fiddle in an offset nut into one of the underclings as well.
