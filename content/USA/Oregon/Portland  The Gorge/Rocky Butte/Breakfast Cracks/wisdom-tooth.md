# Description
Start in the right side of the theatre just left of Wall of Shadows.  Follows the crack system to a nice ledge rest before the business begins.  Jam or layback the blocks that lead directly below the area where bolts used to protect the straight up finish.  End at the chains for Chaitanya.

This route was recently cleaned and may have some nature still throughout.  The blocks appear to want to leave the wall eventually, but seem to be solid currently.  All info on the route courtesy of Tim Olson's PRC, Bill Coe, and the rest of the RBCC.

# Location
Begins at the north end of Breakfast Cracks, in the theatre just prior to Wall of Shadows.

# Protection
Fixed anchors.  Nuts and gear to 3".  Chopped bolts along the crux and past the anchors.
