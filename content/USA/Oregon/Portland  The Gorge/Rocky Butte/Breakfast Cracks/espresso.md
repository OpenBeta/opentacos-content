# Description
Super sweet and easy hand crack, with ample crimps and smears to help things along. Rock is a little polished, but takes gear well. The crux is definitely the last two moves, and the anchor building options are limited. There is a stout chain around a tree used as a TR anchor, so check it out as you rap down.

# Location
Easiest of the Breakfast Crack climbs to find: look for the giant chain. Rap down from above.

# Protection
Gear to about small hand size. Good gear all the way, two #3 Camalots would have been better than one. No bolted anchor, so if you're leading, look it over closely first!
