# Description
Looking for a classic chimney close to home? About 100 feet right (west) of the Rise Up Arete/Tete Gully routes is a clean prominent clean chimney starting 40 feet up. Steep blocky climbing above boulders - don't pass up gear opportunities - leads into the chimney. There are excellent face holds out right, but you'll have to wiggle left to place pro deep in the crack. Nuts work best. Exiting to the ledge out right and the anchor is the crux. An optional 4 inch cam protects the finish. Thanks to Josh Elliott for placing an anchor and uncovering this forgotten gem from the 80s.
