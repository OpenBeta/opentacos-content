# Description
No really, some of the best steep bolted rock in the Portland metro, like Wild Things at Madrone or Critical Mass at Broughton. Start up Chaitanya (trad gear), then mantle out right into the lichen patch to clip the first of 5 bolts. Traverse the hand rail right, balance up the arete, then work up the left face on an intoxicating flurry of steep jugs. At the last bolt, either step left and tackle a powerful sequence ending at a massive jug above the anchor, or step right for a slightly easier finish using the arete briefly before heading back left to end up at the same massive jug.

In keeping with the memorial theme of this wall, this route was put up with Jerry Dellorusso in mind. You were the first climber I ever met, I remember seeing your gear in the closet at college and you talking about this place called the Gunks and driving 95 to get there, and I didn't even know what climbing was back then. I didn't climb until later and we never climbed together, but in your final year you'd started climbing again and we were making plans to finally rope up. You left this place too soon but you left your mark on me and many. Love and miss you, I'm so glad I got to know you.
