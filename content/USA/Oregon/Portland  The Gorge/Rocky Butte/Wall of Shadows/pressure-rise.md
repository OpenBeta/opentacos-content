# Description
This potential link-up is obvious, but hasn't yet been tried, and will make an excellent fully bolted sport route. Clip the first 6 bolts on Rise Up, step left onto the good rest on the arete, then finish up on the last 4 bolts of Pressure Drop. Due to the full recovery rest this won't up the grade from Pressure Drop, but this line will include the cruxes of both routes and ought to thrill sport climbers.

# Location
Start on Rise Up, step left into Pressure Drop.

# Protection
10 bolts
