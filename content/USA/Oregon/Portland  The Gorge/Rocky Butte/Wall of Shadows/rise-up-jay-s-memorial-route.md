# Description
A well protected and fun sport route with distinct and memorable movement. The route shares the start with Tete Gulley and moves left over the steep arete after the shared 3rd bolt, and before the crack crux of Tete Gulley. After the steep arete, Rise Up generally follows the arete on right side with a variety of fun movement and committing moves. Mostly 5.9-5.10 climbing with a distinct 5.11- crux. The crux is tightly bolted along with rest of the route after leaving the shared start of TG. Watch the rope and your feet as you move up after the 4th bolt to keep the rope in front of you. The anchor is equipped with stainless steel carabiners for lowering.

The route is a memorial tribute in honer of Jason Walston. Jay was a kind individual, generous friend to many, a beautiful human, father and my best friend since elementary school. Jay lived in Bend, Oregon and passed away on March 5th, 2021 at the age of 44. Jay touched the lives of many during his 44 years on earth, and his spirit will always be missed. It is my wish that Jay's passion to push himself mentally, rise up physically to a challenge, and send the gnar, live on through those who climb this route. Rise Up. J's Memorial Arete.
