# Description
A sporty start up three bolts, then goes on gear once you hit the wide, left trending crack.  After pulling above it, move over into the corner and just head straight up to the anchors.

This route is dedicated to the memory of Tete Gulley, a black trans woman who was found hanging from a tree at Rocky Butte on May 27, 2019. The Portland Police ruled it a suicide, but there is significant evidence to warrant further investigation.

More information about the murder can be found here:

# Location
Left of center on the Wall of Shadows, starting just right of Chaitanya.  It is best accessed from Skidmore & 90th, a 2 minute approach from the street, parking on the shoulder. Alternatively, you can walk down and around the corner from Breakfast Crack.

# Protection
3 bolts, then a standard rack to the top--a #4 is helpful if you have one.
