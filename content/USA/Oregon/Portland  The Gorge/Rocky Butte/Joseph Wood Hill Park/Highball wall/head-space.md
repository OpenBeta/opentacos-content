# Description
Really fun warm up on great holds before doing harder highballs. Good for getting into a highball “head Space”.

# Location
The first section to the right of the staircase, about 6 feet to the right if the pillar next to the stairs. The obvious pinch is a left hand hold.

# Protection
Pads
