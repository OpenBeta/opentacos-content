# Description
A nice long climb that combines portions of two severely neglected climbs, Walk On Water & Eye In The Sky, into one enjoyable pitch. Begin Sky Walker from the 20 foot anchor at the base of Mind Games. Start as per Walk On Water by climbing over the 5.10 bulge. Keep trending left past Phylynx to get to the arête. Climb straight up the fun headwall/arête until reaching an anchor just below the lip.

Sky Walker is a safe lead at a moderate grade, which is something of a rarity at the Quarry.

After some investigating, it appears that this hybrid route had not been freed. If you know otherwise, please let me know.

# Location
Location information not given

# Protection
Bolts and minor gear to 2”. There’s a short section of climbing before the bolts that takes gear. Using runners before the headwall/arête helps with the rope-drag. Fixed anchor both at the top and the bottom of the climb.
