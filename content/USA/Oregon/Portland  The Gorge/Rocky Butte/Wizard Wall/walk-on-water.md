# Description
Start by gaining the belay ledge, either by rappelling in or climbing up 20' from the forest floor. Walk On Water and Phylynx share the same start. After the “5.10” bulge, wander to the right towards the independent line of bolts, near the Mind Games chimney. Things start out innocently enough with Walk On Water. There’s some nice edges and feet at opportune times. At a small bulge in the route, things start to get difficult. The remaining 20 to 25 feet the climbing is intense with few breaks in the action. Lots of deadpoints to small crimps. Not as classic as Phylynx but fun nonetheless.

# Location
Between Phylynx and Mind Games.

# Protection
Bolts and minor gear to 2”. There’s a short section of climbing before the bolts that takes gear (same start as Phylynx).

For top-roping, tie off to the Phylynx tree. Back up with a long runner from the Mind Games anchor.
