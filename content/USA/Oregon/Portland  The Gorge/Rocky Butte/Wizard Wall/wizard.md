# Description
Wander up Mind Games until you get to a big ledge about halfway up the cliff. There’s a roof just above you at this point. This is where Wizard diverges from Mind Games. Cut right by underclinging the roof until you reach a juggy crack. Follow the angling crack until it peters out. Tricky face climbing and some arête slapping will take you the last twenty feet to the top.

# Location
Just right of the Mind Games chimney.

# Protection
Gear to 2” and bolts.

Wizard can be top-roped by tying off to a fir tree above and backing up with a finger sized gear at the top of the climb.
