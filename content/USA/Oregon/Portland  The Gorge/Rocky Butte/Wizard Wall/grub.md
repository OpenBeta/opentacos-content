# Description
Also known as God Monster in the Rocky Butte Quarry guidebook. This starts at the Eye in the Sky lower anchors and up the left-facing wide crack. Getting through the split rock bulge is the burly crux. After the crux, continue onto a dirty wide ledge with a tree. Then up a short section to the top where the Skywalker tree anchor lives.

# Location
Rappel from the Eye in the Sky top anchor to the bottom chain anchors. Look straight up and you'll see a massive wide left-facing crack which is your route. The Eye in the Sky tree or bolt anchor is your best option for toproping

# Protection
Tree and  bolt anchors above. Gear to 3"
