# Description
Starts on a ledge, about 40 feet up from the ground, with a pair of chain anchors. These anchors are shared with the large crack of Grub to the left. You make your way up the ledge, then around the large bulge which is the crux of the route. Then make your way leftward over to the arete. Continue up to the tree or chain anchors

Skywalker utilizes the upper half of this route and offers a more natural feeling route. The only distinctive difference of Eye in the Sky is the bulge crux.

# Location
From above, spot the outcropping of rocks with the backup hanger which marks the top of Phylynx. The tree to the right is a good anchor and there is a ledge downward with some anchors, along with rappel rings on quick-links.

From below, look for the "Bite" bubble graffiti at the bottom of the Wanderer. A high ledge with chain anchors to the left marks most of the Wizard Wall climbs. Look further to the left of that for the ledge with some rusted chain anchors on top

# Protection
Gear to 1.5 inches. Bolts on the upper half. Runners suggested. Chain anchors at top and bottom. Tree anchor on top 10 feet back
