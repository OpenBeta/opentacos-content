A well-bolted line with a couple of challenging moves on the bulge. Start off on slab and end on slab. Top rope can been set up on the tree at the top or rappel down then lead your way back up.

# Location
Just left of Orient Express dihedral.

# Protection
7 quick draws, bolts are a bit old but they're close together.
