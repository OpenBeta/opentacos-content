# Description
This is a route from the ground up to the top of the Far East halfway ledge. This gets you to the bottom of most of the Far East climbs, such as Orient Express. Climb the left-facing crack to the top of the ledge.

Also known as Eye of the Tiger in the Rocky Butte Quarry guidebook. Tiger's Eye is likely a reference to the chatoyant gemstone rather than "Eye of the Tiger" which is a hot single released by American rock band Survivor in 1982.

# Location
This is located just below Orient Express. It has its own rusty chain anchors. From below, look for the #3 sign on the tree. The ledge is behind that tree, which is also the top of the route

# Protection
Chain anchors at the top
