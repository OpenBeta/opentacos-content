# Description
Start just to the left of the left-facing crack below the 1st bolt. Its a slabby face climb without great feet or hand holds. Smearing is essential

# Location
From the bottom, look to the right of the shallow dihedral which is Orient Express. You'll see a long of bolts just to the left of a left-facing crack.

From the top, look for the fattest tree along the sliffside, which rests on the top of a prow. The next prow to the left should give sight of the top chain anchors

# Protection
Set of chain anchors at the top
