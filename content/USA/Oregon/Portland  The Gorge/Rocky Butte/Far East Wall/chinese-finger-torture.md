# Description
Start by ascending Great Wall of China, or finding a way to shimmy left from the bottom of Ghost Rider. The crack just runs below the triangular roof feature, below the tree on the ledge above. Make your way up and right of that feature, continuing about all the way to the ledge tree. Once you get to the slightly overhanging face at the base of the tree, at the large horizontal crack, you can traverse leftward or just burl up and over the bulging arete

# Location
From below look for the #3 sign on the tree, marking the bottom of Orient Express. To the left of the ledge, look for the triangular roof feature.

From the top, setup a rappel on the chain anchors or tree anchor then move right and down.

# Protection
Chain Anchors. Tree Anchor about 5 feet from the top
