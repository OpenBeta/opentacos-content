# Description
Aptly named. Start up the crack into a corner. Then a flakey crack that flares out into a wide crack that tops onto a dirty ledge with brush. From there, a final shallow stemming corner takes you to the anchors

# Location
From below look for the #3 sign on the tree, marking the bottom of Orient Express. To the left of the ledge, look for the "Bite" bubble letter graffiti for the start

From the top, setup a rappel on the chain anchors or tree anchor then move straight down.

# Protection
Chain Anchors. Tree Anchor away 5 feet from the top
