# Description
Start with a thin crack and smearing feet. Snag a jug and move up onto the slab. Use holds in the seam and crimps on the right face. The angle steepens in the middle and you have to move onto the face. Finish up a lower angle slab that trends right to the anchors.

# Location
Obvious right-trending bolted seam that starts in front of a hearty fir tree on the main ledge.

# Protection
Quickdraws. Bolt Anchor.
