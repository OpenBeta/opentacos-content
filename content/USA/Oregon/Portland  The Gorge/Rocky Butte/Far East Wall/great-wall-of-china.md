# Description
Starts at a crack to the right of The Wanderer. You can take the crack proper all the way. A variation could utilize the crack along with the dirty, shallow channel to the left for a hairier slab ascent

# Location
From below look for the #3 sign on the tree, marking the bottom of Orient Express. To the left of the ledge, look for a birch tree next to a faded graffiti tag that says "Hi".

From the top, setup a rappel on the chain anchors or tree anchor then move right and down.

# Protection
Chain Anchors. Tree Anchor away 5 feet from the top
