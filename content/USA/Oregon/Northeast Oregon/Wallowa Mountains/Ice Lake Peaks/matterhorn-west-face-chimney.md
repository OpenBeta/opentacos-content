# Description
Dave Jensen had this to say on the 2 big Matterhorn climbs he did: "The Grade IV (up the West Face chimney) was much the better climb--fun exciting free climbing in cracks and chimneys to a ledge one pitch below the finish.  The V was aid climbing in the hard places with hammock bivouac followed by a ledge bivouac.   Poor rock and dangerous on both climbs.  A lot of work hauling in there.

# Location
Drive through Enterprise to Joseph on Highway 82, and keep going to the end of the highway at the south end of Wallowa Lake. The Wallowa Lake trailhead is at the very end of the road, elevation 4,600 feet. Take the West Fork Wallowa River trail.

# Protection
