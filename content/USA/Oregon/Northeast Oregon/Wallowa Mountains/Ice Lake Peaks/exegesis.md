# Description
From the Hurricane Creek Trailhead follow the trail approximately 2.5 miles until a creek crossing is found.  Cross to the east side of the creek and begin following Thorp Creek for another 2.5 miles.  Upon arriving at the base of the NNE face, begin the steep climbing at an obvious large rock outcrop to the right of center.  Work your way straight up the face, encountering rock towers intermittently dispersed between steep snow slopes (up to 70 degrees).  Nearing the top, traverse to the right and join the NW ridge to the summit ridge.

No permanent belay/rappel stations exist.

Descend via the NW ridge and Hurricane Creek Trail.

NOTE:

If snow slopes are steady and the rock is covered, climb the steep snow, if they are unstable and the rock is clear, climb the rock.  Move fast and light as snow begins to soften in the mid-late morning.  (Soloing may be the safest way to climb.)

# Location
Northeast Face of Sacajawea Peak, Wallowa Mountains, Oregon.

# Protection
Limited rock protection (passive gear if any), no screws late in the winter/early spring (but maybe bring a short one just in case), plenty of good spots for pickets on the lower slopes.
