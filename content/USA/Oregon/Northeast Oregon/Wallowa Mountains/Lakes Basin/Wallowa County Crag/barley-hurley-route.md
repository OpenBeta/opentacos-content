# Description
Lots of moderate climbing, with three prime pitches of 5.9 hand cracks.

The route has a few nice ledges on it, and climbs a buttress just east of the main south facing headwall. Once you reach the summit of the route, you can easily scramble across the ridge to the main head-wall summit.

# Location
This climbing is visible from Lakes Basin, in the Eagle Cap Wilderness Area. You can reach lakes basin from ToPan, Hurricane Creek and Wallowa Lake Trail heads. I believe the best for approaching the cliff, is from Wallowa lake trail head and camping at Horseshoe Lake, appx 9miles.

The photo/topo i posted is from Horseshoe lake.

# Protection
double set of cams.
