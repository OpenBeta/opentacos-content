# Description
Take a scenic hand crack to a good ledge; followed by a short section of fists.  An overhanging crux start is rewarded by solid rests and great protection.

# Location
From Horseshoe lake, take the trail east until you find a lake covered in lily pads.  Bushwack directly north for about a quarter mile until you come upon a series of granite walls.  The crack is close to the rightmost end of the wall.  Eagle Cap is clearly visible from the belay.

# Protection
Medium nuts to .5-.75 cams. A number 4 cam may be helpful for the topout.
