# Description
Overhanging, pocketed, pump fest! Maybe there are 4 natural holds on this route?! Same start as Iron Lung (stick clip recommended) but head straight up after surmounting the roof. Very consistent climbing (read: endurance!) to a good rest on a flake, then fight a mini boulder problem directly under the chains. Get on it!

# Location
Starts the same as Iron Lung (immediately right of Dung Beetle) and goes straight up to its own chains.

# Protection
11 bolts + anchor
