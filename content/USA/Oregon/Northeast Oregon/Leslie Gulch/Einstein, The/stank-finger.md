# Description
A nice independent line on the right side of the crag.  A surprisingly tricky start gives way to mostly cruiser pockets till a balancy move to the 4 bolt.  Get back what you can, then the angle kicks back and offers super sustained sequential pocket pulling on the 25-30 degree headwall.

# Location
Right side of the crag, left of the 11b but starts to the right of the overhanging cave-like start, not a link-up so it goes pretty much straight up

# Protection
bolts
