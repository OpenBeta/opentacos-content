# Description
Starts on small pockets and crimps up to large huecos leading into powerful, somewhat awkward climbing through a couple of overlaps with a marginal rest or two. Once on the upper panel, move up and right on pockets to the 'burrito' hold and fire through two monos to a difficult clip at the penultimate bolt (long draw helpful here). From here, a strenuous move to a two finger pocket marks the redpoint crux and the end of the major difficulties. Pumpy and reachy power endurance climbing through various pockets and edges leads through another bolt and the anchors.

# Location
Right of Stool Sample. Climbs up under the left-most of 3 obvious huecos about 20' from the deck.

# Protection
8-9 bolts
