# Description
Start with a fun mantle move (stick clip recommended) and launch into overhung, pockety goodness to a rest below a roof. Pull the roof (funky!) and traverse left through consistent pockets into the finish of Dung Beetle.

# Location
This route begins directly to the right of Dung Beetle. After pulling the roof, traverse left and finish on the last 2 bolts and anchors of Dung Beetle.

# Protection
9 - 10 bolts + anchors
