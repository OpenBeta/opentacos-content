# Description
Long route that many people use to warm up.  Starts with a couple burly moves to traverse out onto a slightly less than vertical face. Get a no-hands rest here, then launch straight into the crimpy crux. Continue up the wall on small crimps and pockets to chains.

# Location
Furthest left route on the Einstein Wall.  See pic in area description.

# Protection
Bolts.
