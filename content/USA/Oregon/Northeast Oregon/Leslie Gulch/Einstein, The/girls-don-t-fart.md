# Description
Clip the first bolt and pull up the cruxy start on crimps to solid undercliings.  Chalk up and then fire the steep headwall on deep pockets to anchors on a ledge.  In my opinion, this is by far the best warmup available; steep moves on big holds.  Easy on the hands and tendons.

No hands rest at the chains of Girls.  Extension is called Silent but Deadly and goes at 13a.

# Location
Middle of the wall.  The most obvious, and most chalked, line.  See pic in area description.

# Protection
Bolts.
