# Description
This is the granite ramp that goes up the NNW face of Gunsight Mountain. It offers three pitches of easy climbing. The ramp is typically snow free by mid July but can be damp. Many choices for gear but the crack may need a bit of cleaning - thus the name.

# Location
Gunsight Mountain lies directly above Anthony Lake and can be approached by hiking part way up the Hoffer Lakes Trail and then veering off to southeast.

Descend off the backside to the south then hike to the southwest to Angell Basin which is between Gunsight Mountain and Lee's Peak and returning to the Hoffer Lake trail.
