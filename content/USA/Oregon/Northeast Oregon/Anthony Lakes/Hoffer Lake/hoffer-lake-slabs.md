# Description
Climbing is on assorted cracks and slabs that offer a wide variety of climbing at easy to moderate levels of difficulty.  Excellent quality rock and great views the surrounding peaks and position.

# Location
Above Anthony Lakes lies a small basin that contains the Hoffer Lakes.  Follow th etrail leading to Hoffer Lakes.  there are clean slabs of granite on the right side of the trail at about at the head of the basin.  There are many possiblities for top roping and leading on varied cracks and slabs rangining in difficulty form 5.4 to about 5.8 or 5.9.  Interesting fact - Lute Jerstadt ran an adventure school in the early 70's that used these slabs for the rock climbing portion of the course.  some location information may be found through the outdoor program at Eastern Oregon State College in La Grande.

# Protection
Generally this is a top rope area, but can be lead with cams and nuts.  Bring an extra rope to tie off as long runners from trees and boulders on the top of the cliff.  it is easy to walk around either end of the cliff.
