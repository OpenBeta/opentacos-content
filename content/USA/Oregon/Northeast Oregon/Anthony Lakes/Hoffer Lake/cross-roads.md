# Description
Begins as a finger crack but dies out before reaching a horizontal crack. It continues as a fist crack.

At the time there were a couple of bolts at the top - these were probably placed by Lute Jerstad in the early 70s when he ran a climbing school.

# Location
On the trail up to Lee's Peak via the Hoffer Lakes trail on the right side is a 75' slab of granite. Towards the top of the trail is a large gap between the slabs. To the right of gap are cracks. Crossroads is the third from the left.

Given the bolt at the top this may well be one of the Hoffer Lakes Slab Routes.

# Protection
Mid size nuts and cams
