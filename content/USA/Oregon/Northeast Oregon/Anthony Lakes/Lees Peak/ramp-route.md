# Description
This is the ramp on the north facing side of Lee's Peak and can be seen from Anthony Lake. Often holds snow late into the summer but can be by-passed by climbing on the face ramp of the ramp rather than in the corner. Three easy pitches of climbing can be found on the ramp. The second pitch which moves around a block can be challenging if water is present. Pro is solid but may be well spaced. The crack on the right side starts out quite large but narrows as it goes up.

# Location
Descend to the northeast to Angell Basin which is between Gunsight Mountain and Lee's Peak and returning to the Hoffer Lake trail.
