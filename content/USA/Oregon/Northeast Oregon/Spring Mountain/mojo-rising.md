# Description
This is on of the best routes I have climbed at the forested area where the trail comes up to the cliffs. Climb a short slab to a shallow dihedral that moves you out onto the gently overhanging face.The crux for me was some powerful moves on good holds out the overhanging section. Up higher is a really fun left leaning edge.

# Location
To the right of the sphinx crack.

# Protection
10 Bolts to chains.
