# Description
Steppin out starts with face climbing on a small buttress that aims for a crack over right. Use this crack for several feet before "stepping out" left to navigate a series of barn door inducing edges. Great, technical climbing through the crux on this one.

# Location
10' right of Get a Grip, just left of Van Golden Brown crack.

# Protection
7 bolts to chains.
