# Description
A short finger cranking route with a bolt protecting the crux.  The route follows a discontinuos finger crack that trends left around a small flake and straight up to a rounded layback .  Though the crux is probably 11+, placing gear off the sustained finger locks before it bump the grade.  It is far easier to place a couple pieces at the little flake and then gun for the bolt, but the finger lock section also accepts perfect stopper placements if you got the lock strength.

# Location
Just left of Gran Delusion, a broken crack and chimney system.

# Protection
medium to large stoppers, and a couple .25-.75 cams, a bolt protects the crux.
