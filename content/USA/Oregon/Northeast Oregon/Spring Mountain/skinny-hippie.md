# Description
Interesting and longish route. The crux is an ackward lay-back/ stem over the left side of dog show. I know many climbers who struggle with the ackward crux, but I found it fun.

# Location
Shares a start with dog show before climbing left around a corner and finishing on the upper face.

# Protection
8 bolts to bolted anchor
