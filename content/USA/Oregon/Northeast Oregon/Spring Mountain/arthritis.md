A tricky sequence a couple moves up will make you wish you placed a couple good pieces right off the ground, well-named route as the locks are a bit "strenuous".

# Location
obvious overhanging finger crack that splits a blank face near the middle of the wall, the base is usually obscured by brush, chain anchors

# Protection
standard rack
