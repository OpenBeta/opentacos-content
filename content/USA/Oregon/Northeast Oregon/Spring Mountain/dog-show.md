# Description
This is a powerful, but short line that gave me a full value pump. Mostly long reaches on good in-cut pockets up some overhanging terrain. I thought that the technical crux was the first move onto the face, but when going for the red-point it was definitely holding on for the ride. A really good route requiring some technique and also some power.

On a side note I am pretty sure some chipping was done on this route.

# Location
In what I believe to be the "forest area." This is one of the first routes you come to where the trail meets the cliffs. It shares a start with "Skinny Hippie" and can be discerned from the other routes by the obvious overhanging finish.

# Protection
5 or 6 clips and two rap bolts for an anchor. Given the popularity of this route it is a candidate for lower-offs.
