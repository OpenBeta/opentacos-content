# Description
Just like Godzilla's foe by the same name, this beast has three "heads". Begin in the dihedral right of Summertime Arete. Stick clip first bolt and climb the face (5.10a) or use the crack (5.7). After the 6th or 7th bolt there are three ways to finish. For the middle or right head, down climb a bit and unclip the last bolt on the "torso" after you clip the first bolt on the "neck" to prevent rope drag. Left head (5.10b, 11 bolts): Continue straight up on a slab on the left side of the crack/chimney system and crimp up a steep rounded arete to a ledge with cold shuts. Middle head (5.9, 15 bolts): From friction slab above ledge, step right across a wide dirt-filled crack and climb a steep but juggy face to chain anchors at the top of the cliff. Right head: (5.9, 15 bolts) From ledge with chains for Summertime Arete step right across crack to steep knobby face. Climb straight up to chains at the top of the cliff.
