# Description
Clip the anchors for Wanderer and continue straight up into a dihedral with fun liebacking (5.9). Clip the rap hangers and come down from underneath the big roof or make a sketchy traverse right past two bolts to reach another crack/dihedral system. Follow a tips crack straight up (soft rock and small gear) and then move right underneath another bulge (crux) staying to the right of a wider crack. Beware of rope drag after the roof. You'll need a 60 meter rope to top-rope.
