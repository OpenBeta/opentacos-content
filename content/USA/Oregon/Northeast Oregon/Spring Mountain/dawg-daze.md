# Description
This fun little crack climbs a left facing dihedral to a small roof. Pull the roof and get established on a ledge, then climb a really nice hand crack in a pod to another small roof. Step right at this roof and tackle another nice but short crack to reach the chains. The crux was the first roof although the final crack is not a gimme either.

# Location
The second crack to the right of Lorraine.

# Protection
standard rack should do
