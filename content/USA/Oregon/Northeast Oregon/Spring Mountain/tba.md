# Description
The direct start takes off just to the right of Rally Race and climbs a short overhanging section with 4 bolts.  The climb continues up and left via a crack system to 1st set of anchors.  Head up and right of first anchors for the extension and 3 more bolts.  Upper section was dirty/loose but recently cleaned and new anchors installed.  Rock is fairly soft at the top of the cliff, thus the bolts.

An easier variation is to start on Geophysical then move left once past the overhang.

# Location
Central Segment, between Rally Race and Geophysical

# Protection
Mixed.  Pro to 1".
