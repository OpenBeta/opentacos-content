# Description
The last route on the cliff. This one lives up to its name if you enjoy steep rock with big holds. Start at the same place as Clean Sweep and climb straight up a system of fractures and blocks (they're solid) to a ledge. A few tricky slab moves get you to the top of the route.

# Location
