# Description
Climb steep smooth face using arete on right, pull through an overhang, move slightly left and then scamper up a blunt arete and around a big block. Shares anchors with A Few Tense Moments and is therefore also easy to set up for a top-rope from above, although you might want a directional quick-draw lower down.

# Location
Face climb 10 ft. right of A Few Tense Moments.

# Protection
8 bolts to quick-clip chains.
