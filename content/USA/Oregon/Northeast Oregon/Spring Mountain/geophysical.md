# Description
A really fun but somewhat dirty crack that ascends the main wall. The crux was a really fun fist crack in a dihedral that turned OW on me, I believe that this is where it gets geophysical. the route then finishes up a dirty hand crack in a dihedral. Good stuff.

# Location
at the left side of the main wall or amphitheater.

# Protection
Mixed. there are some bolts next to easily protectable cracks, I dunno I clipped them so I am not going to cry about it.
