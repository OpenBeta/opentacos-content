# Description
A great lead for a beginning tradster. This is a really good route for the grade. It climbs large dihedral with a perfect hand and finger crack up to two bolts on the right face of the dihedral. I have been told that one can exit left out the roof but I am pretty sure this is rarely done.

FA around 1984 by Bob Branscomb, Kristi Stouffer, Jack Kay and Linda Hall.

# Location
One of the first routes you come to on the approach. This crack is in an obvious large dihedral with a huge featureless roof.

# Protection
standard rack and two extra runners for the bolted anchor.
