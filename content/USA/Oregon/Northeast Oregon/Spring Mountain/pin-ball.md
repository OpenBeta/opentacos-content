# Description
Sustained 5.10+ climbing leads to good rest on a small ledge before an awkward dyno off a two finger pocket to a good jug by the final bolt. This route is far more interesting if you only stem off the opposite wall to the first bolt. (Shares anchors with Spring Fever)

# Location
To the right of Spring Fever inside the cave, on your left as you walk up toward Maid in the Shade

# Protection
Bolts (At least 11)
