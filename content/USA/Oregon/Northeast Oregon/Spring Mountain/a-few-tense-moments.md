# Description
A tricky boulder-problem start leads to thin face climbing above. The final moves surmount an exciting blocky overhang. The route is moderate 5.10 if the right arete is utilized for the middle portion (above the third bolt). A few more "tense moments" can be had by eschewing the arete and climbing straight up the thin crimpy face (5.11). This route is unusual for Spring Mountain in that it is easy to set up for a top-rope from above (without leading).

# Location
Start at left edge of small roof 20 ft. right of Jack and Jill

# Protection
9 bolts to quick-clip chains.
