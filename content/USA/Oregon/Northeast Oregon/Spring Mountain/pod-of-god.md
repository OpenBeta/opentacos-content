# Description
This is a fun little crack route that shares an anchor with Rally Racer. I think this is a great lead for someone starting out on trad as it protects very well. The pod is a pretty fun feature and the crux seemed to be coming out of the pod. Single pitch with bolted anchors.

# Location
This is at the start of the Amphitheater to the left of Rally Racer. Rally Racer is the obvious, large detached flake.

# Protection
Standard rack.
