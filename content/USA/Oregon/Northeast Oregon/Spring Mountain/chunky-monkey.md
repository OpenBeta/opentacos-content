# Description
A nice long route that starts in the crack left of Chubby Hubby.  Wide variety of styles.  There are anchors at the top of the first block but with a 60m rope you can continue up and right for one long pitch.  Some loose blocks at the top below the anchors but there are plenty of options on the face to the right.

# Location
In the "central segment" just left of Chubby Hubby

# Protection
16 bolts, chains.
