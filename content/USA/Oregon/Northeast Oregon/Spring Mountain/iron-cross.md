# Description
Start near crack 10 ft. right of Blue-tailed Skink. Cross crack between 1st and 2nd bolts and climb face just left of crack to large ledge with Blue-Tailed Skink anchors. Scramble up more ledges, clipping two bolts, until large handholds allow an exciting move right onto a slabby face. Climb this fun face to a corner with large blocks below an overhang. A series of exciting "iron cross" moves left and out around the overhang establishes you on a final short face just below the anchors. This is a long, fun climb with lots of bolts. 20 to be exact.
