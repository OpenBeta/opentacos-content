# Description
Climb the bolted arete to the right of Spacey Face staying on the left side of the arete.

The name and the grade is simply a description as I am unsure if it was ever formally named by the FA party. I have also not climbed it so I am unsure of the exact grade - thus the old 5.9+ grade is used.

# Location
Start on the right side of the block at the base of the face.

# Protection
Bolts
