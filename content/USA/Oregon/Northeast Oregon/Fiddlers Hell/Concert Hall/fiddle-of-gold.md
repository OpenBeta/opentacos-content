# Description
Side pull the arete that terminates the right side of the bulging face.  This leads to an enormous no hands rest, although it's (VERY) early for a rest.

Follow the bolt line up and right.  Pull the immediate mini-roof to a position at the flaring crack.

Climb the easier (sustained 5.10+) broken-up vertical face to a no-hands (if you can find it) rest below the intimidatingly enormous roof.

Pull hard on big moves on great jugs to the anchor.

NOTE:  This route is exceptionally difficult to clean on rappel or while being lowered.  You may have a partner clean this on their way up the clipped end of the rope, on top-rope.  I will try to get some permanent draws donated from a manufacturer by Summer 2015.

# Location
The line that takes on the full center of the imposing roof at the top of the CONCERT HALL sub-area.

More importantly, this is an amazing climb for its grade, in a perfectly remote location to only be climbed by the lucky few who get there.
