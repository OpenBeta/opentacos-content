# Description
Slots and edges present a route up the convex face. A good stance precedes a n open dihedral with a left-facing corner crack, shaped like a left-facing crescent.

Follow the more broken face up to the weak left side of the medium roof. Pull the resulting roof/bulge. Climb the finish dihedral to the anchor on the left face.

(There is an extension to this route which continues up and over a 5.11 roof.)
