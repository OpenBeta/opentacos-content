# Description
Shares the first 5-6 bolts with

Fiddle of Gold

At the first mini roof take the left bolt line up a bulging/crescent left-facing corner crack. Climbs the wavy dihedral-bulges to the anchors.

(A fun extension to this route is to link route 4 on the end of route 5. Use a long sling or double quickdraw to minimize drag. This brings the grade more in around 5.11.)
