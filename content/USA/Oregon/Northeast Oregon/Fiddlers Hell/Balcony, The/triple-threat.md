# Description
Climb the right face of the dihedral through a very-mini-roof. Enjoy a stance before traversing onto the left tan face.

Pull a quick, strenuous roof on great holds. Enjoy another stance, then pull a more thoughtful bulge/roof to a thin exit.

The final face is a great finish to the anchor.

# Location
Begins up the right face that forms the obvious dihedral, at the left side of THE BALCONY sub-area.

# Protection
<12 bolts, to a 2-bolt anchor
