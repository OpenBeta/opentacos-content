# Description
This fine send warms up, then takes you through a technical sequence to a stance below the low-crux.  You will find the crux becomes obvious when you reach from quality slots on edging feet.  A rest, then sequential sustained 5.10 climbing to the chains, will test your endurance.

If you aren't smiling at the top, find another sport.

# Location
This is the second (from left) route on the STRINGS sub-area.  Take a very short (5ft) walk up to a belay pad among scrub-oak, on the left end of the STRINGS sub-area.

# Protection
10 bolts, to a 2-bolt anchor (with chains)
