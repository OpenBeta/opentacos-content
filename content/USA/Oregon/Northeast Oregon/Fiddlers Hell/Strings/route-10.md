# Description
Assault the the obvious low mini-roof.  Climb the face to a rest at the right side of the prominent ledge (40 feet off the deck).  Spider climb up the swooping arete until you arrive at a perplexing decision, near the top...will you take the thin face, or the thin arete?

# Location
Towards the right corner of the STRINGS sub-area.  This is the tenth climb (eight bolted climb) from the left side of STRINGS sub-area.  This route starts below the obvious mini-roof that is 4-5 feet wide, just off the deck.

Belay from a ledge that is about 5 feet above the main deck of STRINGS sub-area.

# Protection
<12 bolts, to a 2-bolt anchor
