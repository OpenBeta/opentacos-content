# Description
A very low, crimp-compression crux through the bulge, leads to slightly easier climbing on very small crimps through the first 5 bolts.  The finish wanders between 5.10-11 arete movement to the chains.

# Location
This is the third (from left) route of the STRINGS sub-area.  Belay from large pad/trail at the base of the rock, just below the scrub-oak, at the left side of the STRINGS sub-area.

# Protection
10 bolts, to a 2-bolt anchor (with chains)
