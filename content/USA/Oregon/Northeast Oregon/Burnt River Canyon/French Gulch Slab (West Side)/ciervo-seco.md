# Description
The left-most route climbs the face past an intimidating roof trending right to share the anchor with Vacas Muertos. The first bolt is pretty high off the deck.

# Location
This is the left-most route of four.

Decent: rappel or standard AAC clean & lower. A 60m rope is more than enough.

# Protection
--4 bolts

--Two-bolt anchor with rap rings
