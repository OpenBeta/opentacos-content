# Description
This route climbs a dihedral with a left-facing crack. The jams are sharp, but secure except for a couple loose chock stones fidgeting to pop out. The juggy face holds on the arete will cause less capillary bleeding.

# Location
This is the second-right route of four.

Descent: rappel or standard AAC clean & lower. A 60m rope is more than sufficient.

# Protection
--5 bolts

--Two-bolt anchor with rap rings
