# Description
Offering great views and pleasant exposure, this route summits the Astronomy Tower, which is the taller of the two connected pinnacles. Begin at the gully and move right onto the face. Halfway up, a ledge will bring you around to the right side of the arÃªte, where the climbing continues. Above the 7th bolt, a short section of handcrack can be protected with a #2 or #3 Camalot. Rap the route with one 60 meter rope.
