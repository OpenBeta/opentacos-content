# Description
This route traverses the obvious left-angling handcrack across the gully from the Astronomy Tower. While harder than it looks, the climbing is never difficult. There is no bolted anchor; belay from the tree and scramble down the back side.

Use caution as there is loose rock at the start and finish!
