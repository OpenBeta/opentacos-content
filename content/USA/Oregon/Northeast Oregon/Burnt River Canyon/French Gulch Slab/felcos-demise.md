# Description
Good holds with fun moves. Crux is about half way up.

# Location
Left most route on the wall.

# Protection
Bolted, approx 8 bolts to a 2 chain anchor. The chains are thinner than standard and one of the hangers is an old angle iron hanger. I opted to traverse to the rap ring on the route to the right.
