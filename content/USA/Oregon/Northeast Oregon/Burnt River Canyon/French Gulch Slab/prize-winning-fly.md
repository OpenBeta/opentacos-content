# Description
Fun easy slab with some really fun pockets. Crux is a high friction section about half way up. Seems like some hard slab moves for a 5.7, but I was in approach shoes.

# Location
Right most climb on the wall. Climb up onto the ledge then up the cracks to the right. First bolt is after you get up on the ledge.

# Protection
Bolts, well protected to rap ring anchor.
