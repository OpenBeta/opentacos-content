# Description
Route starts at the SW base of the Large Ear. A short and easy chimney leads to a mantle on the right. The route scrambles along the top of the feature to an overhung mantle followed by a small crevasse that can be reached across. Summit has a cairn that is visible from the approach.

I did it as a roped solo and it took the entire rope (60m). Moving about on the summit is comfortable without being tied in.

# Location
From the mountain goat infested ridgeline just to the west, follow the goat trails towards the ear, as far to the north as possible. Route starts on the furthest north, easily acessible chimney.

# Protection
Double cams from .75 to 5. Pro was nice to have on the mantles, rather unnecessary on the rest.
